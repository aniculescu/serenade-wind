      <p>Rachel J. Slocum is a fast, comfortable one-off staysail schooner capable of sailing at 7.5-8 knots in almost any wind condition, and staying there. She usually gets more looks than any other boat in the harbour. There was only one rule given to the designer: nothing must compromise sailing ability. With its huge sail area and lean hull, Rachel J. Slocum begins cruising upwind at 4.5 knots in open-ocean conditions at only 4 knots of breeze while most other vessels must rely on their motor, and gets to the next anchorage, under sail, faster than you or others will believe possible. The captain can choose between wind vane or electric auto pilot to maintain an excellent track in varying wind conditions.</p>
      <p>Rachel J. Slocum took 1 year to design and 3½ years to build with private US and British inspectors, and with the present owner, on site every step of the way. She is ABS certified (ABS Certificate No. KS 6055X). The owner, who grew up on sailing yachts and whose father owned Concordia Boat Yard and Marshall Marine in Padanaram, Massachusetts, took care to incorporate every good idea learned after nine continuous years cruising around the world in a different yacht. She has been continuously refit and upgraded since launch, with no consideration to cost. Everything works. </p>

      <p>Vessel track record with same owner: 1.75 comfortable world circumnavigations via Cape Aiguilles/Cape of Good Hope (twice), Cape Horn, Tasmania (4 times). Seven crossings of the Pacific, twice across the Atlantic. Extensive cruising South China Sea area, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Patagonia, South and North Pacific, north and south Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean. Storm characteristics: excellent. Vessel can and has hove-to safely in open Southern Ocean conditions to 60 knots with a reefed main staysail. Light-wind characteristics: unbelievable. The fisherman, with it’s high moment aloft, prevents rolling and sail flogging in big ocean swells, allowing the boat to sail in extremely light breezes where others can’t.</p>
      <p>This is a yacht that was designed for one couple who wishes to sail the world immediately in comfort and style, and with speed, with provision for three live-aboard guests on an occasional basis. She is “ready to go,” with nothing that needs to be upgraded or fixed.</p>
