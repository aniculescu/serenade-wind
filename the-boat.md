# Introduction
s/v Rachel J. Slocum is a fast, comfortable one-off staysail schooner capable of sailing at 7.5-8 knots in almost any wind condition, and staying there. She usually gets more looks than any other boat in the harbor. There was only one rule given to the designer: nothing must compromise sailing ability. With its huge sail area and lean hull, Rachel J. Slocum begins cruising upwind at 4.5 knots in open-ocean conditions at only 4 knots of breeze while most other vessels must rely on their motor, and gets to the next anchorage, under sail, faster than you or others will believe possible. 

The captain can choose between wind vane or electric auto pilot to maintain an excellent track in varying wind conditions. With her first owner, she has completed a world circumnavigation via Cape of Good Hope & Cape Horn, including fast crossings of the Pacific Ocean (seven times), Indian Ocean (twice) and Atlantic Ocean (twice). 

Rachel J. Slocum took 1 year to design and 3½ years to build with private US and British inspectors, and with the present owner, on site every step of the way. She is ABS certified (ABS Certificate No. KS 6055X). The owner, who grew up on sailing yachts and whose father owned Concordia Boat Yard and Marshall Marine in Padanaram, Massachusetts, took care to incorporate every good idea learned after nine continuous years cruising around the world in a different yacht. She has been continuously refit and upgraded since launch, with no consideration to cost. Everything works. 

This is a yacht that was designed for and will appeal to one couple who wishes to sail the world immediately in comfort and style, and with speed, with provision for three live-aboard guests on an occasional basis. She is “ready to go,” with nothing that needs to be upgraded or fixed.

# Why are we selling

After a mere 6 months of ownership, we decided that a cruising life was not in the cards for us. s/v Rachel J Slocum is an amazing example of a vessel made for world exploration in every sense of the word. In our short time as owners, we invested the literal blood, sweat and tears into making her ready to make way offshore. On the open sea is where she belongs, not tied up to a dock. 

The obvious question would be: What's wrong with the boat to motivate a sale so quickly? 

The answer lies in the explanation above.  There's nothing wrong with her, she was a substantial financial investment on the heels of liquidating all other wordly posessions (and many of the comforts that come with a land life). Our decision to abandon our cruising plans was by far one of our hardest challenges. This sale is simply part of moving on, not in any way a reflection of this fine sailing vessel.
