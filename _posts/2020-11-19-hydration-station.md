excerpt: It's easy for Andrew and I to be hyper-focused on what we're doing and neglect some of the basics, like making sure we drink enough water each day. So, when my feet suddenly ballooned into Hobbit feet, we decided to make hydration a priority.

# Missing Icon

A few days after moving aboard, our stores of water were close to depleted, and I searched around the boat for the [Icon LifeSaver Cube](https://iconlifesaver.com/products/cube/?v=7516fd43adaa) that both Bill and Raquel separately demonstrated how to use. They went to great lengths to extoll the virtues of this product, and it was nowhere to be found. 

That's odd.

I asked Andrew to send a message to Bill, to which Andrew quipped, "Why don't you send a message to him?" I replied through gritted teeth, "No, you won't want that."

We had been moving our gear on board, and these were long days of cleaning a filthy, smelly boat (due to a wedge of blue cheese ensconced in the refrigerator for a couple years) in hopes of transforming it into a habitable space. I was also still prickling over Bill's shenanigans with charging us for his [extensive inventory](/posts/survey-sea-trial-part-5/) of fasteners, blocks and shackles that were already part of the purchase agreement. His behavior struck me as a bit shady.

The message that Bill sent back admitted to taking the Icon off the boat and had already shipped it to Nevis. His second text message provided a link of where we can buy our own. 

What else did he walk off the boat with that we don't know about? We didn't exactly make a detailed inventory of its contents. Bill had agreed to sell the boat with all its contents except for family heirlooms. 

Like I wrote, shady.

# Boiling Over

After venting to Andrew, I decided to take the high road and focus on solving our new problem. We decided to boil the tap water that came through the galley faucet. This worked for a few days. As I was making coffee and tea each morning for us, I would boil a great deal more water, then let it cool and transfer the water into Nalgene bottles. 

When Andrew made the coffee and tea in the morning, he wasn't as diligent with setting aside water as I had, so our stores of water once again ran low. Over the ensuing days of sweating it out on the boat, neither Andrew nor I was drinking enough water. He would help himself to beers at the end of the day, but I had no other option of quenching my thirst. 

One day, as Andrew was sorting through a bucket of bolts and I had spent the day writing and budgeting, I stood up in the saloon. I noticed my skin had tightened around my ankles and feet. I looked down and saw unusual swelling.

I had Hobbit feet.

When I pointed this out to Andrew, he suggested we go for a walk and that the solution was to get my blood circulating. I nodded, and we headed down the street in search of a restaurant recommended to us by our neighbors Lucy and Charles.

# Listening to Nature 

As we were walking, we toyed with the idea of stopping by [Jerk Machine](http://jerkmachine.com/) to get some Caribbean take-out, but I said that I honestly can't stomach the idea of eating something spicy and hot after being in a sauna all day. I was craving fruits and vegetables. In retrospect, my body was signaling to me that I needed to hydrate in whatever form I could find it. It's no wonder that I had gobbled down a bunch of grapes we brought home one afternoon. I haven't acted like that since I was a kid.

I was reminded by something captain Rich said about how your body would tell you what it needs if you listen to it. Your diet in the tropics will be far different than living in Maine or Wisconsin, for example. If you pay attention, you'll be better off and healthier than insist on eating what you're used to.

No more eating on autopilot.

Now that water was front and center, Andrew voiced his concern and wanted to prioritize our health (including ensuring we stay hydrated) over anything else. It seems our focus on things - the boat, our gear, cleaning, inventorying, etc. - had preoccupied us, while our bodies suffered in their service to our goals.

# Reprioritizing Boat Jobs

When we returned from our walk, we brought home a gallon of alkaline water and guzzled it down. We also sampled the water out of the galley by way of comparison.

It tastes pretty awful. 

The next day, Andrew changed the carbon filter on the cold water line in our galley with high hopes it will improve the taste. Note that every other day, I refill our holding tank with tap water from the Ft Lauderdale municipality. The carbon filter could help remove some of the taste from how the water is treated, but the taste could also be due to the state of the holding tank. We have no idea how long it's been since the holding tank has been cleaned (or if ever) since there's no maintenance record. After all, a wedge of cheese was left behind in a refrigerator by mistake. 

As a result, a new boat project has organically materialized to help us get to know our boat a little better. In the end, I don't think I'll ever take fresh drinking water for granted again.
