# Aaarrr!

On September 19th of each year since 2002, the world over celebrates international talk like a pirate day. 

When I first learned about it a while ago, I thought it was a cute, an interesting way to adapt some speech patterns into my writing, but really didn't invest too much in it.

Now that we are owners of a schooner, we thought we might get a little bit more into the spirit of things.

# International Talk Like a Pirate Day

There's a charming blog that goes into the history, [talklikeapirate.com](http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/). There are loads of fun information and resources, such as [glossaries](http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/how-to/for-further-study/) and [translators](https://www.syddware.com/cgi-bin/pirate.pl) so you can pick up some terms.

# Grace O'Malley

Current Text:

I first learned of Grace O'Malley earlier this year through the Schooner Bums Facebook group. In it one of the members posted a link to an article written about the infamous [Irish pirate queen who conquered a man's world and faced down Queen Elizabeth I](https://allthatsinteresting.com/grace-omalley).

I thought it was pretty cool.

*A sea dog says 't this way. Arrr, so ye be wantin' t' go to sea an' ye don't be wantin' t' end up in Davy Jones' Locker. Then ye best be learnin' t' be talkin' like a buccaneer.*

*I first learned o' Grace O`Malley earlier this voyage through the Schooner Bums Facebook squadron. In 't one o' th' members posted a link t' an article written about th' infamous Irish shipmate queen who conquered a man's world an' faced down Queen Elizabeth I.*

*I thought 't be pretty cool. Ya scurvy dog who ortin' t' be keel hauled! What else ye got? An' be quick about it, I be shippin' out soon!*

# Other Female Pirates

After finding out about her existence, I then began to explore the interwebs. I uncovered quite a few other female pirates and privateers in history, including:

-   Caribbean 
    -   [Anne Bonny](http://www.thewayofthepirates.com/famous-pirates/anne-bonny/) - an Irish pirate operating in the Caribbean, and one of the most famous female pirates of all time
    -   [Mary Read](http://www.thewayofthepirates.com/famous-pirates/mary-read/) - also known as Mark Read, was an English pirate. She and Anne Bonny are two of the most famed female pirates of all time, and among the few women known to have been convicted of piracy during the early 18th century, at the height of the "Golden Age of Piracy"
    -   [Jacquotte Delahaye](https://historycollection.com/women-pirates-every-bit-fearsome-blackbeard/10/) - a pirate active in the Caribbean sea. Alongside Anne Dieu-le-Veut, she was one of very few 17th-century female pirates
    -   [Anne Dieu-le-Veut](https://historycollection.com/10-of-historys-most-fascinating-female-pirates/) - also called Marie-Anne or Marianne was a French pirate. Alongside Jacquotte Delahaye, she was one of very few female buccaneers. While Delahaye was likely fictional, Dieu-le-Veut was real; however, many of her exploits are inventions of later writers

    -   [Ching Shih](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/ching-shih-prostitute-pirate-lord-002582) - a Chinese pirate leader who terrorized the China Seas during the Jiaqing Emperor period of the Qing dynasty in the early 19th-century. She commanded over 300 junks (traditional Chinese sailing ships) manned by 20,000 to 40,000 pirates
    -   [Zheng Yi](https://www.amazon.com/Pirate-Queen-Story-Zheng-Sao/dp/1773061240) - a powerful Chinese pirate operating from Guangdong and throughout the South China Sea in the late 1700s

Operated on the New England Coast. Thought to be the first American female pirate. In 1782, George and the rest of his crew were drowned in a storm. She was accused of robbery in 1789 and confessed to being a pirate. She was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging.
    -   [Martha Farley](https://medium.com/@kimbarrett92/women-in-the-golden-age-of-piracy-745fb710f2) - a deported British woman accused of piracy. She and her two children joined her husband in raiding a few small ships in 1725. She was acquitted when she claimed to have no prior knowledge of the plans.
    -   [Mary Crickett](https://medium.com/@kimbarrett92/women-in-the-golden-age-of-piracy-745fb710f2) - a convicted criminal deported from England in 1728 and forced to work as a slave in Virginia. In May 1729, she was one of six prisoners who stole a small ship and attempted to sail it out to sea. They were all captured and hung as pirates.

-   English Coast
    -   [Mary Wolverston](https://historycollection.com/10-of-historys-most-fascinating-female-pirates/2/) - also known as Lady Killigrew (before 1525 – after 1587), was a gentlewoman from Suffolk, married into an ancient Cornish family, who was accused of piracy during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603)
