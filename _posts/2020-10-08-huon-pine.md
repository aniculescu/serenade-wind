# Typical Dinghy 

When the lockdown was lifted this summer, [Sailing Fair Isle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJH0fF_wXUjARGD-SZfHIQ) made their way through various anchorages in Spain. At one point, they [lost their dinghy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEqkTPbc9mw). Until a new one arrived from New Zealand (see above), they made do with making their way around a stand-up paddle board to get to and from shore. It was less than ideal, but I applaud their resourcefulness, patience and frugality.

In their [latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKsUN1s4BeY), Andrew and I remarked how light and sturdy their New Zealand dinghy appeared. Curious about it, Andrew did some more research to understand more about its features, and it got me to thinking about our Huon Pine dinghy.

As you can see, most cruisers dinghy to and from shore in [rigid inflatable dinghies](https://www.boatus.com/magazine/2016/october/dinghy-basics.asp). They are utility boats used to haul people, gear, and provisions back and forth to their larger cruising vessel. They can also be used to explore coves, catch fish or dive in snorkel spots. Most have an outboard motor to get around. Seldom will you see one with mast and sails. Still, rarely will you see a Huon Pine dinghy with removeable carbon fiber mast and boom, such as ours below.

# Our Dinghy 

In March, we were discussing the terms of purchasing RJ Slocum. Things that come with the boat vs not. Andrew and I unanimously exclaimed that we loved the dinghy, and Bill added the following perspective.

When you single-hand or double-hand a 50' sailboat, you're not really sailing. You pick your course, set your sails then your autopilot and you go. In contrast, sailing a dinghy reconnects you with the basics of sailing and it's a great way to get exercise.  

Jan from the hippo book also remarked how special this dinghy was.

> RJ Slocum's gorgeous dinghy would happily fit in as an exhibit in the Australian Wooden Boat Festival which is held in Tasmania every 2nd February. Boats built from Huon Pine are uncommon and very expensive and are highly sought after here.

I decided to do some research to find out exactly what was Huon Pine and why was this dinghy so special.

Here's what I found out.

# Huon Pine 

[Huon pine](https://www.australianwoodwork.com.au/blogs/news/what-is-so-special-about-huon-pine) is grown only in Tasmania in wet, temperate rainforests and it grows extremely slowly, 1 mm girth per year. They can grow to be 2,500 years old. Their timber has remarkable properties. Because of its high oil content (methyl eugenol), the timber is impervious to insects (marine borer and screw worm) and it's waterproof. Working with this timber is a dream: it can be bent, shaped, worked and sculpted without splitting and finishes with a beautiful lustre from pale straw when freshly cut to rich honey gold as it ages.

Huon Pine is the [prince of timbers](https://tasmaniantimber.com.au/species/huon-pine/). In the early days when these properties were discovered, it was heavily exploited. However, given their slow growth, the Tasman government had begun to conserve and manage the forests of Huon Pine in an effort to protect the future of these venerable giants. 85% of the Huon Pine forests are protected in National Parks. 15% is managed by Forestry Tasmania for salvage, who controls and surveys all salvage and harvesting.

When I shared this finding with Andrew, he was not surprised. His surprise occured back in December when everything about [s/v Rachel J Slocum](/about-rachel-j-slocum/), including her dinghy astounded him. Perhaps I didn't dive into the details because there was so much to take in and therefore it was a surprise to me now. Or, perhaps Andrew isn't really fazed about this revelation, given what we know about Bill and his approach to designing and building Rachel J Slocum. It stands to reason he would take the same care in having her dinghy built.

Suffice it to say, it blew my mind!

# Design 

I wonder how her design compares to the [15' Sandpiper](https://www.marshallcat.com/sandpiper) from Marshall Marine.

# Storm Sailing

Kelly's Life raft vs dinghy 

Now imagine motor dinghy vs sailing dinghy

I feel pretty safe having a spare vessel.
