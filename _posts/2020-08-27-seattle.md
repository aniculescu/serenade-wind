# Planning

[In the arena](/posts/in-the-arena/), we talked about our pre-adventure adventure over the past few months. Saying goodbye to your current life can take an emotional toll. In time, we got over the sentimental items and physical possessions we needed to let go of. When it comes to relationships, however, the impact on everyone is still playing out. 

As we mentioned in [exit stage left](https://www.patreon.com/posts/38860268/), we had a family discussion via Facetime since the girls live with their mom in Washington state. Over the July 4th weekend, we told Emma (10) and Silvia (7) about the decision to move away and live aboard a sailboat. 

After an initial burst of tears, Silvia bounced back from the news and asked a lot of questions about what this would mean. These questions centered on what will happen to the cats Oreo and Xiaolong, whether they'll still be able to see friends and family in California, where to send packages, etc. It took a lot longer for Emma to come around, and she refused to talk to us for a few weeks.

By the following month, we finally had a plan in place to visit them. Due to the constantly changing COVID-19 conditions (for lockdown, re-opening and rollbacks), their mom Rae was unclear of what to do or whether a visit would even be possible this year or next year. 

Naturally, in this situation, we as parents would need to be flexible and not pedantically adhere to a child custody parenting plan. Special circumstances require special consideration. It took *months* of pleading to convince her of a path forward that would be realistic and safe. It took this long because she only wanted to follow the rules of the parenting plan.

## Making Decisions 

Over the years, I've observed that Rae seems to make choices by [avoiding what she doesn't want](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-reduce-your-panic-related-avoidance-behaviors-2584148) rather than defining what she does want. I recognize this behavior, because I used to be this way, too. For me, changing this mindset took a great deal of effort to: 

 - stop automatic thoughts 
 - question your fear that comes from a [negative approach to life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760598/) 
 - make decisions by seeking positive outcomes rather than to avoid negative ones  

>“One comes to a decision based on what one wants, not based on what one doesn't want.” ~ Jan from the movie Beautiful Girls 

After proposing a lot of ideas which were shot down, we only found agreement because it followed the rules of the parenting plan. Andrew and I would travel to Seattle, stay nearby at an AirBnB for about a week and visit the girls only during the day. 

This was a far cry from our original proposal in March, which was to have them spend the entire summer with us in California during the lockdown in order to build a relationship with them. Quel dommage! 

Once again, we are reminded to [go with the flow](/posts/going-with-the-flow/) and focus on what we can, which is the [present](/posts/past-present-and-future/).

# Roadtrip

We decided to make the most of this roadtrip adventure. We are packing up our car with boxes of books, toys, sentimental items, car seats and anything else we can think of that the girls would need or [love to have](/posts/matching-gifts/). 

In our zero emissions car, we have mapped out all of the stops that would be required to recharge along the way. This adds 4 hours to the trip while at the same time saves $161 in fuel charges.

I borrowed the format from [Sailing is Truth](https://sailingistruth.com/) on a recent passage briefing written up by Maik Ulmschneider. Here is what we have planned so far. 

## Passage Briefing 

Synopsis: These will be hot days driving on the freeway. The major challenge will be to keep Denise from overheating.

 - Port of Departure: Anaheim, Orange County, CA, USA
 - Port of Call: Mill Creek, Snohomish County, WA, USA
 - Distance: 1,190 miles

 - Duration: 23 hrs
 - ETD: Friday, August 21, 2020 14:00 UTC-7
 - ETA: Saturday, August 22, 2020 13:00 UTC-7

Weather: Based on the [10-day forecast](https://www.weather-forecast.com/maps/California) for California, we expect...
 - Sea State: N/A
 - Temperatures: [H 3X°C (9X°F) L 2X°C (7X°F)]
 - Tides: N/A
 - Warnings: No storm warnings in effect. 

Hazards:
 - Watch for slow moving traffic during commute hours in/out of city centers
 - Numerous construction zones along the entire route
 - Watch for slow moving traffic and 40 mph construction speed limit
 - Check for alternative charging stations; delays due to capacity
 - High wind advisory in mountain passages 
 - Traffic reduced to 2 lanes due to brush fire

## Watch System 

This is also a great opportunity to experience a watch system over a 24-hour period and help us with passage-making preparations at sea. 

 - Watch 1: 14:00-20:00 Denise (split into 3-hour shifts?)
 - Watch 2: 20:00-02:00 Andrew
 - Watch 3: 02:00-08:00 Denise
 - Watch 4: 08:00-13:00 Andrew (split into 3-hour shifts?)

Historically, Andrew is a night owl and I'm an early bird. Luckily, with my erratic sleep-cycle, I don't have to do much adjustment from my usual routine to handle the second half of a night watch. I'll take the 2-8 a.m. watch until Andrew wakes up, assuming he is able to fall asleep in the car. 

## Provisioning 

I suppose we could also take this one-step further and provision with sandwiches and snacks, rather than helping ourselves to fast-food options along the way. Regardless, we will need to make our scheduled stops to top off our batteries for the journey.

# Visit

Describe the activities of lockdown with the girls. Show them pictures of the boat. Make plans for a future visit in the spring.

# Reflections

Reflect on the visit and what it means.
