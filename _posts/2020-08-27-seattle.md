# Planning

[In the Arena](/posts/in-the-arena/), we talked about our pre-adventure adventure over the past few months. Saying goodbye to your current life can take an emotional toll. In time, we got over the sentimental items and physical possessions we needed to let go of. However, when it comes to relationships, the impact on everyone is still playing out. 

As we mentioned in [Exit Stage Left](https://www.patreon.com/posts/38860268/), we had a family discussion. This was conducted via Facetime since our girls live with their mom in Washington state. Over the July 4th weekend, we told Emma (10) and Silvia (7) about the decision to move away and live aboard a sailboat. A few weeks later, we had a plan in place to visit them.

# Roadtrip

We decided to make the most of this roadtrip adventure. We are packing up our car with boxes of books, toys, sentimental items, car seats and anything else we can think of that the girls would need or [love to have](/posts/matching-gifts/). 

In our zero emissions car, we have mapped out all of the stops that would be required to recharge along the way. This adds 4 hours to the trip while at the same time saves $161 in fuel charges.

I borrowed the format from [Sailing is Truth](https://sailingistruth.com/) on a recent passage briefing written up by [Maik Ulmschneider](https://www.facebook.com/maik.ulmschneider). Here is what we have planned so far. 

## Passage Briefing 

Synopsis: These will be hot days driving on the freeway. The major challenge will be to keep Denise from overheating.

 - Port of Departure: Anaheim, Orange County, CA, USA
 - Port of Call: Mill Creek, Snohomish County, WA, USA
 - Distance: 1,190 miles

 - Duration: 23 hrs
 - ETD: Friday, August 21, 2020 14:00 UTC-7
 - ETA: Saturday, August 22, 2020 13:00 UTC-7

Weather: Based on the [10-day forecast](https://www.weather-forecast.com/maps/California) for California, we expect...
 - Sea State: N/A
 - Temperatures: [H 3X째C (9X째F) L 2X째C (7X째F)]
 - Tides: N/A
 - Warnings: No storm warnings in effect. 

Hazards:
 - Watch for slow moving traffic during commute hours in/out of city centers
 - Numerous construction zones along the entire route
 - Watch for slow moving traffic and 40 mph construction speed limit
 - Check for alternative charging stations; delays due to capacity
 - High wind advisory in mountain passages 
 - Traffic reduced to 2 lanes due to brush fire

## Watch System 

This is also a great opportunity to experience a watch system over a 24-hour period and help us with passage-making preparations at sea. 

 - Watch 1: 14:00-20:00 Denise (split into 3-hour shifts?)
 - Watch 2: 20:00-02:00 Andrew
 - Watch 3: 02:00-08:00 Denise
 - Watch 4: 08:00-13:00 Andrew (split into 3-hour shifts?)

Historically, Andrew is a night owl and I'm an early bird. Luckily, with my erratic sleep-cycle, I don't have to do much adjustment from my usual routine to handle the second half of a night watch. I'll take the 2-8 a.m. watch until Andrew wakes up, assuming he is able to fall asleep in the car. 

## Provisioning 

I suppose we could also take this one-step further and provision with sandwiches and snacks, rather than helping ourselves to fast-food options along the way. Regardless, we will need to make our scheduled stops to top off our batteries for the journey.

# Visit

Describe the activities of lockdown with the girls. Show them pictures of the boat. Make plans for a future visit in the spring.

# Reflections

I suppose its odd to look for a silver-lining during the coronavirus pandemic. We seem to have found them everwhere, as we have taken this time to prepare for a voyaging life. This included:

-   [provisioning](/posts/free-will-or-fate/) by walking to the grocery store instead of driving
-   learning to be more [self-sufficient](/posts/set-your-waypoint/) by making repairs with whatever we have on hand rather than buying a replacement
-   assessing [how much water](/posts/water-water-everywhere/) we'll consume while showering
-   [upcycling](/posts/upcycle-r-us/) whenever we can
-   reducing our waste by [going green](/posts/going-green/)
-   increasing awareness of how we impact the world by becoming [ethical sailors](/posts/ethical-sailing/)
-   having culinary adventures by experimenting with [all-pantry recipes](/posts/canned-food-recipes/)
-   and finally the newest addition, practicing a [watch system](/posts/seattle/) while on passage
