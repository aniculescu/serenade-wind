excerpt: While on the hard, we decided to make the most of our time and mapped out all the boat systems. In Part 4 of the Survey & Sea Trial series, we also describe what to expect from a sea trial.

# Tracing Boat Systems

A few weeks before we set out for this trip, we tried to get up to speed on electrical systems. While we can totally geek out on this topic, we decided to take a practical approach and understand electrical systems and wiring but creating our own diagram of what's going on behind the panels. 

After reviewing a few [Pacific Yacht Systems](https://www.youtube.com/user/PacificYachtSystems) videos, we spent a few hours mapping out the wiring from shore/solar/alternator to batteries including charge regulators, jotting down the wire and fuse sizes that were installed, battery switches, breaker panels, etc. and comparing this information to Bill's diagrams.

We also took the time to do the same to understand the other boat systems including:

 - fresh water system
 - watermaker
 - propane
 - toilets (water intake, holding tank, pump out, discharge)
 - all through-hulls
 - engine fuel
 - engine/transmission cooling water 

[The Boat Galley](https://theboatgalley.com/knowing-your-systems/) has a great write-up on getting to know your systems.

# Evaluating Storage Options

The measuring exercise during [our first look trip](/posts/project-slocum-part-1/) was far from thorough. With the time we now have available and access to all hatches and lockers, we decided to blow them all open and mark down the sizes as well as current contents. 

As we wrote previously in [Living Space](/posts/living-space/), Bill has spares for days stored aboard the boat and we wanted to inventory all the bits and bobs and where they are located (at least at present). We diligently filled out our bullet journal and then converted them digitally so that we can create a searchable inventory file.

# Searching for Galley Supplies

I've been kicking myself for months after the first look trip in March to see [RJ Slocum](/about-rachel-j-slocum/). I wished at the time that I had taken measurements of the gimbaled stove and oven, especially the interior volume so that I could hand-select which of the baking supplies would fit inside. 

Using the Force 10 dimensions that I saw aboard *Rapport* a 2001 Tayana 48 during [our Seattle trip](/posts/seattle/), I surmised my standard commercial grade aluminum sheets would not fit. I wasn't quite sure the half sheets would work. Quarter sheets, 13 x 9 Pyrex, muffin and loaf tins would comprise my arsenal from here on out.  

So we checked out the local restaurant supply stores in [Ft. Lauderdale](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=suppliesrestaurant&find_loc=Fort+Lauderdale%2C+FL) and compiled our wish list.

# Exploring Dockage Options

We also checked out various marinas to see where we could affordably liveaboard short-term before we head south. Currently, s/v RJ Slocum is docked at [New River Castle & Dockage](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Vacation-Home-Rental/New-River-Castle-896938200359894/). Other places we considered included:

 - [Royale Palm Marina](http://royalepalm.com/marina/) 
 - [Harbour Town Marina](http://www.harbourtownemarina.com/)
 - [Coral Ridge Yacht Club](https://coralridgeyachtclub.com/) 
  
Other options throughout Florida are listed in [Living Aboard](https://www.living-aboard.com/florida-liveaboard-marinas.html).

# Expanding Our Social Circle

We are also actively looking to expand our social circle to the sailing community. We looked in on some friends of Bill (Jonah lives in Miami), Facebook friends (Suky Cannon) and introduced ourselves to the Miami Yacht Club.

# What can you expect from a sea trial?

Before we jump into the sea trial, I referenced a great write-up again by PC Marine Surveys on [what to expect on a sea trial](http://www.pcmarinesurveys.com/Sea%20Trials.htm). Some key highlights include:

 - ensure all engine and steering gear hatches are open for full access underway
 - be at the helm when the boat is started to see whether all gauges respond properly
 - listen and watch fuel filters/lines, motor mounts, gear engagement, stuffing boxes, hoses, impeller pumps, exhaust systems
 - look for leaking hoses, leaking exhaust, excessive movement of stuffing boxes, and shaft vibration
 - ensure steering cable, quadrants, hydraulic hoses, tiller arms and/or tie rods are secure and responding appropriately
 - upon return, take note of gauges and readings of oil pressure, temperature, volt meter, tachometer
 - throttle to full operating temperature and evaluate readings
 - raise sails and inspect sails and running rigging
 - ensure all winches, clutches, furlers, cars and tracks are operable
 - while cruising at idle, run all other systems (stove, water heater, navigation and anything electrical)
 - when secured back on the dock, test the windlass and inspect ground tackle

[Secrets of a sea trial](https://www.passagemaker.com/cruiser-reviews/secrets-of-a-sea-trial) published in Passage Maker provides an account of what happens when builders conduct a sea trial of a new boat. 

Owners are not invited because it could give them pause when they witness running a diesel engine at wide open throttle (both in and out of gear) or cutting doughnuts in the sea by making fullspeed turns with the rudder hard over. The purpose of these sea trials is to shake loose the troubles when the water heater leaks or the lights don't work and to get them fixed. 

Reading these accounts were an eye-opener for us, and we hope you also find these resources useful as well.

In the final part of the series, we'll take you through how RJ Slocum fared in her sea trial.
