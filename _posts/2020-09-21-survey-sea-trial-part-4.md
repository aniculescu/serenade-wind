# What can you expect from a sea trial?

Before we jump into the sea trial, I referenced a great write-up again by PC Marine Surveys on [what to expect on a sea trial](http://www.pcmarinesurveys.com/Sea%20Trials.htm). Some key highlights include:

 - ensure all engine and steering gear hatches are open for full access underway
 - be at the helm when the boat is started to see whether all gauges respond properly
 - listen and watch fuel filters/lines, motor mounts, gear engagement, stuffing boxes, hoses, impeller pumps, exhaust systems
 - look for leaking hoses, leaking exhaust, excessive movement of stuffing boxes, and shaft vibration
 - ensure steering cable, quadrants, hydraulic hoses, tiller arms and/or tie rods are secure and responding appropriately
 - upon return, take note of gauges and readings of oil pressure, temperature, volt meter, tachometer
 - throttle to full operating temperature and evaluate readings
 - raise sails and inspect sails and running rigging
 - ensure all winches, clutches, furlers, cars and tracks are operable
 - while cruising at idle, run all other systems (stove, water heater, navigation and anything electrical)
 - when secured back on the dock, test the windlass and inspect ground tackle

[Secrets of a sea trial](https://www.passagemaker.com/cruiser-reviews/secrets-of-a-sea-trial) published in Passage Maker provides an account of what happens when builders conduct a sea trial of a new boat. 

Owners are not invited because it could give them pause when they witness running a diesel engine at wide open throttle (both in and out of gear) or cutting doughnuts in the sea by making fullspeed turns with the rudder hard over. The purpose of these sea trials is to shake loose the troubles when the water heater leaks or the lights don't work and to get them fixed. 

Reading these accounts were an eye-opener for us, and we hope you also find these resources useful as well.

# Our observations

Since we had an earlier than scheduled haul out, we were able to get underway with the sea trial on the same day. Bill turned the helm over to Andrew who steered us out of the canal and onto Stranahan River. 

Bill got the main sail ready, unzipping the sail bag and making sure none of the lazy jacks would foul hoisting the sail. He also decided to put a reef in the main. Then, Bill and I ran the furling line through the blocks and then led the jib lines aft to the cockpit. 

Swells were 3 feet high and about 5 seconds apart as we motored out of onto the Atlantic. As Bill assessed the wind condition, he decided to deploy the staysail first and then let out the jib. We mostly let Bill handle all the lines except when he needed help. It seemed quite a bit of the running rigging was tight or fouled. Cranking on the winch seemed to yield very little progress and I wonder if this was due to the fact that she hadn't been sailed for over a year. Are these the typical sounds one would hear? 

Once both sails were out and we were on a starboard tack (close reach), we cut the motor and we were sailing!

From the deck, Ian had a look at the rigging. Given the standing rigging was redone in South Africa 3 years ago, he didn't go aloft. He did notice a cotter pin missing in the turnbuckle of the backstay. When he was back in the cockpit, we tacked and set a course for Dania Beach to test the ground tackle. We sailed on a close reach for about an hour. Andrew and I each had turns at the helm while Ian and Bill went down below to test and evaluate the systems. 

These 90 minutes of sailing was by far the highlight of our day. After dropping anchor for a test of the windlass and evaluation of the chain's condition, we motored back into the marina. 

# What's next?

It'll take a couple days for us to find out the results of the marine survey from Ian before we can take any steps further with the transaction. In the meantime, over the next few days, we'll be tackling some repairs and upgrades (refrigeration), arrange dockage for RJ Slocum in the near term and schedule a second haul out for bottom paint and buffing sides when we return to Ft. Lauderdale.
