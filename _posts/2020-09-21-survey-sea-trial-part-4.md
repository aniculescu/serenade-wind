# What can you expect from a sea trial?

Before we jump into the sea trial, I referenced a great write-up again by PC Marine Surveys on [what to expect on a sea trial](http://www.pcmarinesurveys.com/Sea%20Trials.htm). Some key highlights include:

 - ensure all engine and steering gear hatches are open for full access underway
 - be at the helm when the boat is started to see whether all gauges respond properly
 - listen and watch fuel filters/lines, motor mounts, gear engagement, stuffing boxes, hoses, impeller pumps, exhaust systems
 - look for leaking hoses, leaking exhaust, excessive movement of stuffing boxes, and shaft vibration
 - ensure steering cable, quadrants, hydraulic hoses, tiller arms and/or tie rods are secure and responding appropriately
 - upon return, take note of gauges and readings of oil pressure, temperature, volt meter, tachometer
 - throttle to full operating temperature and evaluate readings
 - raise sails and inspect sails and running rigging
 - ensure all winches, clutches, furlers, cars and tracks are operable
 - while cruising at idle, run all other systems (stove, water heater, navigation and anything electrical)
 - when secured back on the dock, test the windlass and inspect ground tackle

[Secrets of a sea trial](https://www.passagemaker.com/cruiser-reviews/secrets-of-a-sea-trial) published in Passage Maker provides an account of what happens when builders conduct a sea trial of a new boat. 

Owners are not invited because it could give them pause when they witness running a diesel engine at wide open throttle (both in and out of gear) or cutting doughnuts in the sea by making fullspeed turns with the rudder hard over. The purpose of these sea trials is to shake loose the troubles when the water heater leaks or the lights don't work and to get them fixed. 

Reading these accounts were an eye-opener for us, and we hope you also find these resources useful as well.

# What's next?

Over the next few days, we'll be tackling some repairs and upgrades (refrigeration), arrange dockage for RJ Slocum in the near term and schedule a second haul out for bottom paint and buffing sides when we return to Ft. Lauderdale.
