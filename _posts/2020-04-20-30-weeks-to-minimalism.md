  30 weeks to minimalism begins with a game plan and time. Rather than replace a busy schedule with another busy schedule, give yourself time. Find stillness in the day for introspection and self-discovery.

# What is minimalism?

If you are new to minimalism, here is the elevator pitch: [Minimalism](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/what-is-minimalism/ "Becoming Minimalist") is owning fewer possessions.

{% include sticky-note.html text="Reduce possessions" %}

This sticky note has been featured heavily on our original [whiteboard](https://www.serenadewind.com/posts/time-to-go-to-the-whiteboard/ "Time to go to the whiteboard"). It was also among the first of our short-term goals Andrew and I tackled. We gave it a good go by taking the activity one room at a time in August 2018 and again in October 2019. In the process, I offloaded a lot of clothes, bags and shoes as well as underutilized kitchen items. Cherished items went to friends, and the rest went to charity.

# Time to Take It Up a Notch

In retrospect, we took a somewhat incremental approach to reducing our possessions. The effect was... meh. In large part, we were missing a strong _why_ to underpin the activity. We now have that: sailing around the world.

Because we want to make this transformative lifestyle change, it demands a pretty extreme definition of minimalism. We have furniture, personal items and household supplies that fill a 3-bedroom house along with a sizable 2-car garage and extensive outdoor furniture. Taking an incremental approach will utterly end in failure to get off the dock, so to speak. Taking a transformative approach much like countless examples in [Living Big in a Tiny House](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoNTMWgGuXtGPLv9UeJZwBw "Living Big in a Tiny House") is what it takes.

Learning from the experience of other live-aboard cruisers, we decided we are not going to rent storage space while we sail around the world. If we sail for 5-10 years, so many variables can change and it doesn't add up:

-   why pay for storage for years (e.g., $100/mo for 10 years = $12,000)
-   we may not use furniture, clothes or items from our distant past
-   our needs inevitably will change

Thus, we will not be hanging on to anything that does not serve a purpose onboard a sailboat. A critical eye will be cast on every article of clothing, every kitchen item, and every tool on the workbench. As other cruisers have indicated, even what they brought was way too much. So, when it comes to purging, we are going to be ruthless.

At the end of the purge, we will be left with a handful of suitcases and ready to go sailing, whether we start from Florida, Germany or British Columbia.

# Game Plan

Thankfully we have a little bit of time to purge our belongings. Accomplishing this transition while keeping our sanity at the same time is one of the driving reasons for taking our time with this.

I have read some examples of breakneck speeds at which folks who are excited to start cruising quit their jobs, buy a boat, sell their possessions and move aboard within a few months time. Neither Andrew nor I are interested in replacing a frenetic schedule with another frenetic schedule.

One of the hardest things to do in this transition is deliberately slow down. I remind myself to [go with the flow](https://serenadewind.com/relationships/going-with-the-flow/ "Going with the Flow"). Finding stillness in the day for introspection and self-discovery. I am giving myself the gift of time to define what gives me joy and purpose in this lifetime.

>"It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great." ~ Jimmy Dugan

# Does it help me fulfill a greater purpose with my life?

In our efforts to de-clutter, we are going beyond the simple question, ["Does it spark joy?"](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/does-it-spark-joy-is-the-wrong-decluttering-question/ "Does it spark joy is the wrong decluttering question") Rather than attach happiness to the items we decide to keep, we are filtering the items to evaluate whether it will serve us in the future. With that lens, we can categorize the items into three buckets:

- **Yes** - These are the items that will be used daily when we are on our sailing adventures.
- **Maybe** - These items will be set aside for a few months. If we don't retrieve them during that time, we don't need them.
- **No** - These items will not have a home in our future. They're too big, too worn-out or simply not a good fit for our new lifestyle.

# 30 Days to Minimalism

We decided not to take the same room-by-room or drawer-by-drawer approach as we did in 2018 and 2019. This time, we are going to take things on by category of items. 

I love Sadia's youtube channel not just for her recipes but also for lifestyle tips. The categories were laid out based on her video [30 days to minimalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24IDJfPCHZM "30 days to minimalism"). Rather than do things in 30 days, we will attempt to do things in 30 weeks or somewhere in between. This way we have time for other activities.
