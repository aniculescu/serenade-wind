excerpt: The sailor who wants to drain the cup his life hands him should become aware of and intimate with the stars in the heavens, the birds in the air and ashore, and the fish below the surface. He will come close then to the very mystery of creation. ~ Boris Lauer-Leonardi

# Marine Life

In our limited experience sailing, we have encountered sea lions, dolphins and whales while day sailing around Santa Monica Bay. Seeing them always brings a smile to my face. We have also witnessed the dazzling bioluminescent waters in Thailand, teeming with schools of fish as they dart among the coral. 

It's no wonder when embarking on a voyaging life, one can seldom feel alone when surrounded by marine life.

## Dolphins

With the October 1955 issue of "The Rudder," Boris Lauer-Leonardi comments on the same topic:

> The sight of a porpoise never fails to gladden the sailor's heart. A friendly mammal, it is intelligent and cheerful and will playfully accompany a boat on her lonely course with a mien that with little imagination appears smiling and happy.
>  
> The porpoise is a sailor's friend. We all are convinced that it will guide him to a harbor in a fog, that it will keep sharks away from him when he is swimming, and if he should become exhausted, the porpoise will nudge him along to safety.

Whether they be a [porpoise](https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2019/02/22/tell-difference-dolphins-porpoises/) or a dolphin (and there's a way you can tell them apart), every day is a good day when you see one breaching the waters alongside your hull. Given their [prevalence worldwide](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/common-bottlenose-dolphin), there's an opportunity to view them wherever we go, especially when on passage when they are [migrating](https://www.biosphereonline.com/2016/05/03/understanding-dolphin-migration/).

## Sharks 

On the day we closed the deal on buying RJ Slocum, we sat around Bill and Raquel's living room. Among the many stories told that rainy afternoon was an account he gave of spending some time in the South Pacific spearfishing. He had two of the 3 tricked out spear guns in the living room, which he demonstrated to us on its use. He left one behind for us on board the boat so he could show us how to spearfish when we drop the hook in the Caribbean.

Anyone new to this lifestyle, us included, would be loathe to want to swim with the sharks, however Bill doesn't let sharks get in the way of his plans. He becomes the aggressor and bullies them until they move on to less annoying waters. 

I understand this in theory, but [in practice](https://blog.padi.com/2018/02/20/tips-for-freediving-with-sharks/)... I suppose it's a more visceral experience than what I am used to in [office politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH9OLQh46FY).

## Lexan View Port

Instead of [swimming with sharks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UH9OLQh46FY), I would much rather flip on the light switch below our boat and lazily observe the marine life safely tucked in the stateroom until my heavy-lidded eyes close for sleep.

# Mermaids

In my perusal of the April 1967 issue of The Skipper, I read a charming article by Margaret Graham Neeson, which began:

> We've never seen one ourselves, but we're perfectly willing to admit that there may be mermaids. Our question is: Who needs 'em? Why are they considered so great, and why would anyone, ever, want to have anything to do with them? It's our own private, well-considered opinion that mermaids, one and all, always were, and probably always will be, a shabby lot. 

She then went to report on accounts of mermaids in the literature 

 - sailors and coastal dwellers were seeing mermaids back in the time of the Babylonians, the Egyptians and the early Greeks
 - results of mermaid sightings were almost always bad
 - throughout the centuries, mermaids were raising sudden storms and squalls, creating confusing mists and fogs, tangling lines, snapping off hooks, and pelting fishermen with dead fish, rocks and curses
 - they sang with usually disasterous results for those who heard them: lured to watery destruction or drove mad with desire

Anthropoligists and zoologists say that what the sailors said were mermaids were really [dugongs](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/dugong#:~:text=Dugongs%20are%20cousins%20of%20manatees,is%20strictly%20a%20marine%20mammal.), [manatees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee) or [seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped). 

I suppose the homesick sailor could be fooled into perceiving the figure of a seal on a rock as a mermaid, but as the author wrote:

>We prefer to believe that when on closer inspection a mermaid turned out to be a seal, it was just those devilish seamaidens up to their dastardly tricks again.

# Birds

When crossing large bodies of water, one may happen on a bird seeking a safe place to land. Some like [petrels](http://creagrus.home.montereybay.com/MtyBayoffshore.html) can be found 20-50 nm offshore. Laura Dekker's documentary featured this in a [poignant scene](https://lauradekkerworldsailingfoundation.com/09-05-2011/). If this were to happen to us, I suppose my natural conclusion would be... we must be close to land which would be cause for great relief and celebration. But consider this...

An [albatross](https://www.famousscientists.org/how-far-can-birds-fly-without-needing-to-land/) can fly roughly 10,000 miles 
over the sea before returning to land. That's like flying non-stop from Houston, TX to Perth, Australia and many commercial jets can't do that.

I enjoy the idea that an albatross may accompany us across the Southern Ocean with us. Unfortunately, we may not be able to keep up, as they clock in at around 15.6 nm to our modest 8-10 nm.

# Never Alone 

This blog is a grab bag of stories and inspiration over the past few weeks touching on the inherent fear that comes with significant passagemaking. We'll be offshore sailing for over 1,000 nautical miles and will not see another soul. 

While we've touched upon our inherent tendency to be [selectively social](/posts/selectively-social/), we see this as an opportunity to be closer to nature and to each other.
