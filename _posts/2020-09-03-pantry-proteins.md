On the heels of reading the [Hippo book](/posts/hippo-book/), I was inspired to go old school... that is... until I realized I hadn't quite mastered what to do with some of the products I would preserve. 

My thought was if I knew what to do with them first *and* if I liked what I tasted, I would embark on trying to preserve and can them. If I didn't like how they turned out, then no harm no foul. If I succeeded, then there's a greater certainty that they will be used.

Did you buy that rationalization? 

There is a vast world of canned proteins - roast beef, chicken, clams, shrimp, etc. - that I have avoided most of my life. In preparation for our voyaging life, I have decided to explore this world of pantry proteins now, beginning with...

# Canned Chicken Salad

After the 3rd straight meal of homemade [Korean jap chae](https://mykoreankitchen.com/korean-glass-noodle-stir-fry-japchae/), I was desperate for something new. I was inspired by a filipino chicken salad sandwich that my friend Helen would bring to me from time to time. It's a perfect blend of savory with a hint of sweet, creamy tender chicken with some crunch, and place it in a Hawaiian roll, and you have a addicting meal ahead of you.

This chicken salad recipe is inspired by whatever was in my house at the time and so it consists of the following:

*Ingredients*

 - 1 (10 oz) can chicken breast 
 - 2 stalks of celery, 1/4" dices
 - 1 cup chopped green onions
 - 1/3 cup Kewpie mayonaise (Japanese)
 - 1 tbl agave

 - 1 pkg Hawaiian rolls (1 dozen)

 - Furikake to taste

*Directions*

Combine first 5 ingredients in a mixing bowl. Slice Hawaiian rolls in half. With a sharp bread knife, I can slice all 12 in one go so you create a sheet of bread, top and bottom. 

Spread all of the chicken salad mixture evenly over the bottom sheet of rolls, and sprinkle furikake to taste. Layer top half of Hawaiian rolls.

Serve as pull-apart sandwiches which are perfect for lunch or snacks while on passage.

*Galley notes*

Naturally, you may not have the same ingredients on hand. To riff on this recipe, think about proportions of wet to dry, soft to crunch, and savory vs sweet. And since everything is cooked or edible raw, taste along the way and adjust the seasoning. Substitutions can certainly work; if you don't have agave, use honey. No Kewpie mayonaise? Cut out the agave, and use Miracle Whip instead. 

In retrospect, this sandwich was a bit on the wet side and I should have drained the chicken a bit more. I wasn't sure how dry the meat would be, so I erred on more moisture than not. I can easily envision adding a binding element like a couple hard boiled eggs chopped to make the spread more cohesive.

# Canned Roast Beef Cheung Fun

[Cheung fun](https://whattocooktoday.com/chee-cheong-fun-steamed-rice-rolls.html) is one of my favorite dim sum dishes. I decided rather than braising beef for hours, I could quickly marinate and season this pre-cooked beef, throw in some fresh cilantro, roll it up in vietnamese rice sheet and top it with scallions and Furikake.  

*Ingredients*

 - 1 (12 oz) can roast beef
 - 1 tsp rice vinegar
 - 2 tsp fish sauce
 - 2 tbl sesame oil
 - 1 tsp agave
 - 1/4 tsp ginger powder
 - 1 cup chopped scallions

 - 2 cups cooked jasmine rice
 - 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves
 - 10-12 sheets of vietnamese rice paper (or bánh tráng)

 - Furikake to taste

*Directions*

Combine first seven ingredients and warm through in a pan stove-top and then set aside.

Place hot water in a wide bowl. This will be used to soften the rice sheets. Working one at a time, assemble the ingredients following these steps:

 1. Soak rice sheet for 10-15 seconds until it softens. Place on a flat service. 
 2. Select 2-3 springs of cilantro leaves and lay them flat in the center.
 3. Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the seasoned beef and scallions and spread evenly on the cilantro.
 4. Spoon 3 tablespoons of rice and spread evenly.
 5. Sprinkle furikake on the rice.
 6. Fold the rice sheet over the filling burrito style.

Repeat until you have run out of any one of the ingredients first. This dish is best when served right away.

*Galley notes*

The challenge with this recipe is that the beef stew is already seasoned. So instead of starting with a blank canvas for flavors, you start with something that skews American/British in terms of flavor profile. 

In order to steer towards an Asian palate, you need to neutralize what is already there, which is done with rice. Finally, to enhance the fish sauce, ginger and sesame flavors, you'll need to amp up the herbs (scallions and cilantro). 

As with all of these suggested recipes, sample as you go so you'll achieve  your desired taste.

# Canned Corn Beef Impossible Pie

Earlier this year, I discovered a recipe from the Kitchen Magpie, and since then I've experimented with all sorts of variations on a theme creating impossible pie with chorizo, bacon and goulda and now the latest... corned beef! Here's the recipe.

*Ingredients*

1 carrot, diced 
2 stalks of celery, diced 
4 stalks of scallions, diced 

2/3 cup of Bisquick 
2 cups of milk 
4 eggs whisked 

1 (12 oz) can of canned corn beef

1 cup of cheddar cheese 

*Directions*

Saute first three ingredients in a pan with olive oil until carmelized. Add pinch of salt toward the end to bring out the flavors of the vegetables. Allow the vegetables to cool to above room temperature. The key here is you don't want to melt the cheese or cook the eggs, so you don't want to have a high contrast in temperature.  

In a bowl, whisk eggs and then combine milk and Bisquick until there are no lumps.

In a pie plate (I use a pyrex), spread cooked vegetables, then sprinkle corned beef and cheese on top, spreading evenly. Pour Bisquick milk mixture and place pie in a 400 degree pre-heated oven.

Bake for 25-35 minutes until puffed golden brown and custard is set. Cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.  

*Galley notes*

The canned corn beef can be overwhelming in these proportions. In the next iteration of this, I would halve the amount of corn beef for this recipe and save half of it for a corn beef hash with a fried eggs.

# Canned Creole Crabcakes

Based on the success of the creole salmon cakes, I thought I would try my hand again at a creole crabcake. Here's [the recipe](/posts/canned-food-recipes/), but substitute salmon for crab.

# Canned Clam Chowder

*Ingredients*

3 strips of bacon, chopped

1 clove garlic, minced
2 tbl butter

1 medium onion, diced
5 stalks of celery, chopped
2 cups of young gold potatoes
2 cups shitake mushrooms

1/4 tsp white pepper
1/2 tsp dried thyme

3 cups of chicken broth 

1 can (6.5 oz) chopped clams with juice
1 can (10 oz) whole clams with juice

1/3 cup AP flour
2 cups half-and-half divided 

Vegeta or salt to taste 

*Directions*

 1. In a Dutch oven, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain; set aside.
 2. Add butter and garlic to the drippings. Then saute onions, celery and mushrooms until tender.
 3. Stir in potatoes, chicken broth, clam juice, pepper, thyme and vegeta. Bring to a boil.
 4. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender 15-20 minutes.
 5. In a small bowl, combine flour and 1 cup of half-and-half until smooth. Gradually stir into soup. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, 1-2 minutes.
 6. Stir in clams and remaining half-and-half; heath through (do not boil). 
 7. Serve in bowl with crumbled bacon sprinkled on top and side of crusty garlic bread. 

*Galley notes*

Be sure to whisk the flour and half-and-half slurry so there are no lumps.
Add vegeta or salt at the end to taste, since the introduction of the clam juice also adds seasoning of its own. In retrospect, I also preferred the whole clams to the chopped clams. I would also add more flour to create a thicker soup. Otherwise, deelish!
