# Recap

After we decided to buy a boat to [sail around the world](/posts/sailing-around-the-world/), we knew we would eventually need to get rid of a lot of stuff. The first part of this adventure was [finding a boat](/posts/boat-purchase/) and also making sure not to buy more stuff and [upcycle](/posts/upcycle-r-us/) whenever we could. 

At some point however, we needed to get serious about downsizing and so we set out a plan called [30-weeks to minimalism](/posts/30-weeks-to-minimalism/). Each color in the photo above denotes a different month in which the activity began. Here's how we fared over the weeks:

 - Week 3 - how to tackle [sentimental items](/posts/throw-back/)
 - Week 6 - [what clothes](posts/packing-light/) should you bring for a cruising lifestyle and how many & what type of [linens](/posts/boat-head/) will we need on board 
 - Week 7 - does a foodie need to sacrifice all her [kitchen gadgets](/posts/sea-foodie/) and what do we need for the [rest of the space](/posts/sea-foodie/)?
 - Week 12 - once you've narrowed down what you want to take, here are some [strategies to upcycle](/posts/matching-gifts/) your stuff
 - Week 15 - don't forget to deal with your [digital assets](/posts/shutterbug/)
 - Week 20 - all the furniture can't come with us aboard, so 80% of the large items moved out over [Labor Day weekend](/posts/talk-like-a-pirate/)
 - Week 22 - [inventory s/v Rachel J Slocum](/posts/survey-sea-trial-part-4/) and determine what we will keep
 - Week 25 - after the survey and sea trial, [edit some more](/posts/whats-next/) 
 - Week 26 - moving aboard s/v Rachel J Slocum

# Minimalist vs Minimalist

When you embark on a transition to downsize, what happens when you come across another minimalist? Battle of the deflectors.

We had a few such experiences where we invited family and friends over to help themselves to free stuff. They turned us down. Oh, they were polite about it... Polite and *unyielding*. Some of them already had begun their own minimalism journey. So while we were thwarted from our goal, we were happy for them. 

As you can see, we had pushed off some things to evaluate until after we got back from Florida. This would give us the chance to take measurements of [s/v Rachel J Slocum](/about-rachel-j-slocum/) while at the same time [take an inventory](/posts/survey-sea-trial-part-3/) of what Bill already had stored on board and what we also wanted to keep. 

If you're part of the [Serenade Wind crew](/posts/join-the-crew/), we will provide the full interactive file as a starting point for your 30-weeks to Minimalism plan.

# Past 2 Weeks 

Since 80% of our stuff was gone by Labor Day, we had a few remaining items to be picked up. We had already transitioned from sleeping in our bed to Silvia's bed. All of our dressers were emptied and now hanging in the closet (yes, including underwear). 

Over the next few years, we will be traveling back to visit family and staying with my mom. Rather than hauling clothes back and forth, we thought we would keep some clothes with her, so we had a chance to set aside some more personal items. This is helpful as well so we can swap out clothes aboard that are threadbare or in disrepair. 

We packed up the Uhaul pod which will be driven to Ft Lauderdale and be available at our dockage in 12 days.

For the remaining items identified, cousins Ellen and Janet as well as friends Nick and Subu were scheduled over the first week of our return to pick up items and suddenly, we were no longer sleeping in a bed, but on the floor in sleeping bags.

We turned over the keys of our Mini Cooper to Janet and Edi to use for the time being until they are able to sell it on our behalf. We also turned over the keys to the Tesla to Nick and Brit, on the condition that they can take us to the airport. Finally, we turned over the keys to the house to my tearful mom. 

The transition to a minimalist lifestyle is complete.

# Predictions 

From time to time, we've all encountered this common and irksome question often asked in job interviews. In 2015, Andrew and I had just married. I don't think I would have predicted Florida and certainly not living on a boat. 

Yet here we are in 2020.
