excerpt: We found inspiration in the work being done by Ocean Research Project and wanted to put a spotlight on the activities that Matt Rutherford is pursing with respect to microplastics, climate change and other research topics.

# Research Charter

Now that we're living on our boat, we have reduced streaming access. While enroute from California to Florida, I thought perhaps one way to still have access to relevant and timely content was to see what other podcasts I could access whenever we did have wifi. 

Based on the recommendations from the Sailing and Cruising Facebook group, I decided to check out "On the Wind" presented by 59 North and in particular the episodes chronicling Matt Rutherford's activities.

 - [Microplastics](http://www.oceanresearchproject.org/programs/science/marine-debris/) - plastics that end up in the ocean are churned by the waves until they are ground into minute sizes that are eaten by fish. What are the implications to us as we also eat the fish that are ingesting these microplastics?

 - [Citizen science](http://www.oceanresearchproject.org/programs/science/citizen-science/) - [Sailing SV Delos](https://www.youtube.com/user/briantrautman) also got into the action by participating in this research project tracking fish along the Atlantic Ocean to help scientists study migration patterns. 

 - [Glacier ocean mapping](http://www.oceanresearchproject.org/go-marie/) - one of the more intruiging expeditions will be undertaken in the next few years aboard their new vessel currently being refit in Annapolis. She happens to also be a schooner. 

 - [Climate change](https://www.oceanresearchproject.org/programs/science/climate-change/) - cruising around the coasts of Greenland, ORP took measurements of warm water flows below the cooler waters. The data they are gathering will help scientists understand its impact on melting glaciers.

# Research vs Sailing?

I am both intrigued and inspired by the work being done by ORP. The idea that cruisers can collect data and information for science to better understand climate change for example is kinda cool. 

Sailing under these auspices has its drawbacks however. Sometimes, they have to slow down and sacrifice average daily miles logged in order to collect better data. Sometimes, it means motoring for days instead of sailing. 

Still, it is worth noodling over to see if there is something we can do in this effort, after all [s/v Rachel J Slocum](/about-rachel-j-slocum/) is certainly capable of these voyages to uncharted waters, and the knowledge can be had for a fraction of the cost of typical research science expeditions.
