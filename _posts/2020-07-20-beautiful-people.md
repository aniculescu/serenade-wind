# Summer Tunes

I love this time of year. I am reminded of sunny afternoons of my youth, speeding down the Pacific Coast Highway, all the windows down, radio cranked up and music spilling out of the car while singing my heart out.

These days, we're not driving around much to do our part to slow down the pandemic. We have our sights on moving at the end of summer, so this is no time to be taking unnecessary risks.

Just because we don't take our usual cruise down the highway listening to Skrillex's Bangarang or System of a Down's Toxicity, doesn't mean we don't ask Alexa to play it at home.

So what are we listening to these days?

# Melody vs Lyrics

When listening to a song, do you gravitate to the melody of it first or the lyrics?

Andrew gravitates to the lyrics, while I gravitate to the melody. Such was the case as well when I first heard "Beautiful People" by Ed Sheeran. However when I learned of the lyrics, I was blown away.

In this place and in this time, the lyrics from "Beautiful People" resonate with me. Fifteen years ago, this would be a nice tune and no more. Since this is a year of great change and transition for us, discarding adopted values that we no longer relate to, this song captures how I feel.

This song is about the so-called "[Beautiful People](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/ed-sheeran/beautiful-people)," a term for those who move in fashionable or glamorous circles.

# Lyrics to Beautiful People

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer  
Sun down and they all come out  
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers  
The party's on, so they're heading downtown  
('Round here)

Everybody's looking for a come-up  
And they wanna know what you're about  
Me in the middle with the one I love and  
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well  
'Cause we are just ourselves  
I could use some help  
Getting out of this conversation, here  
You look stunning, dear  
So don't ask that question here  
This is my only fear  
That we become

Beautiful people  
Drop-top, designer clothes  
Front row at fashion shows  
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"  
Inside the world of  
Beautiful people  
Champagne and rolled-up notes  
Pre-nups and broken homes  
Surrounded, but still alone  
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are  
(We are, we are, we are)  
We are not beautiful  
Yeah, that's not who we are  
(We are, we are, we are)  
We are not beautiful

(L.A., mm)

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere  
(Nowhere, nowhere)  
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there  
(All night)  
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras  
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

We don't fit in well  
We are just ourselves  
I could use some help  
Getting out of this conversation here  
You look stunning, dear  
So don't ask that question here  
This is my only fear  
That we become

Beautiful people  
Drop-top, designer clothes  
Front row at fashion shows  
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"  
Inside the world of  
Beautiful people  
Champagne and rolled-up notes  
Pre-nups and broken homes  
Surrounded, but still alone  
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are  
(We are, we are, we are)  
We are not beautiful (yeah)  
Yeah, that's not who we are  
(We are, we are, we are)  
We are not beautiful

(We are, we are, we are)  
We are not beautiful

>“Beautiful People” is the title of a collaboration between English singer Ed Sheeran and American R&B singer Khalid. The lyrics of this collaboration center on one very important thing – being utterly true to yourself. The song encourages listeners to fight against the temptation of becoming one of those people whose lives center around material things. In the song, Sheeran and Khalid refer to these people as “beautiful people”.

# That's not who we are

... at least not any more. I have several closets of designer clothes, shoes, bags that would be the envy of any fashionista. If you are familiar with "Devil Wears Prada" by [Lauren Weisberger](https://www.laurenweisberger.com/) (perhaps you've seen the movie?) or "Confessions of a Shopaholic" by [Sophie Kinsella](https://www.sophiekinsella.co.uk/), you'll have an appreciation for the brand obsession plaguing a debt-funded demographic in the U.S. The best cars and the best houses which follows having the best schools and the best jobs. In the early aughts, I was jetting around the world launching new businesses, giving speeches, and attending movie premieres & film festivals.

That life has a momentum of its own, but it is not self-sustainable. And the question inevitably crops up:

What is it all for? Is this what happiness looks like?

# Happiness

We explored this topic a few times previously:

-   Redefining our [relationship with money](/posts/relationship-with-money/)
-   [Realizing that happiness](/posts/throw-back/) comes from good relationships. They keeps us healthier and happier. Period.
-   Engaging in meaningful conversations by being [selectively social](/posts/selectively-social/)
-   Focusing as much as you can on the [present](/posts/past-present-and-future/), since that is the only thing you really have control over
-   Finding your own purpose in life and perhaps your [second mountain](/posts/philanthropy/) will bring more fulfillment to you than the first mountain

Fundamentally, we are all social creatures and want to feel a connection to others and a sense of purpose. I found that connection based on social status, brands, what or who you know felt quite hollow.

We are not beautiful people.
