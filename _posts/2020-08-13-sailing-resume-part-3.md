# British Virgin Islands, Jan 2014
Leopard 384 *Serenite*

Hannah invited me to join her on a sailing trip around the BVIs for a couple weeks. As we were emailing each other to exchange information (flight, passport, address, etc.), I happened to ask her the cost of the charter and provisioning. Chartering a Leopard 384 at that time ran us $8,000 (about $1,500 per person), and she estimated food would run $300 per person for the trip. 

> my bf asked me if u wanna be our treasurer-haha-I think u r the most qualified to handle money :) so i say bring at least 2-300 bucks for provisioning-joe says the treasurer has to wear a fanny pack :)

...to which I replied...

> Lol yeah sure, I'd be honored to be the treasurer. Must I wear a fanny pack? 

As you'll see among the final images, I took that job quite seriously. 

When I landed in Tortola, I took a taxi to the Moorings and messaged Hannah. Most everyone had arrived and were hanging out by the pool. Joe was busy blowing up an inflatable swan. Both the swan and the dinosaur made comfortable berths on the trampoline while on passage (the swan aboard *Pipsea* and the dinosaur aboard *Serenite*).

While some continued to relax by the pool, a few of us went to provision. As some of you can tell, I enjoy cooking, so I had a vested interest in making sure I knew what ingredients would be brought aboard. When we returned to the marina, there were last minute reassignments and I was reassigned from *Pipsea* (skippered by Joe) to *Serenite* (skippered by Slava). 

I recall finding out later that Hannah argued with Joe later that night. I wasn't put out by it though. Slava was going to gain a skilled crew (racer, galley cook) who knew her way around a boat, and in retrospect, it really didn't matter. Both boats were a lot of fun, and we would take turns hosting breakfast and dinner aboard at anchor.

## Log Book

On the advice of Charlie from CSC, I began to track my charter experiences in  a sailing log book for this trip. Best decision I ever made. 

The one I use is "The International Marine Log Book" created by C. Dale Nouse formerly editor of Cruising World magazine and executive editor of Practical Sailor magazine. The log book is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/International-Marine-Log-Book/dp/0070482373/). It is complete, compact and durable. It has areas to record your boat's entire cruising history, vital navigational aid, concise and accurate weather-forecasting system (e.g., wind force, sea state, barometer and forecast), daily checklist of your boat's mechanical systems, and becomes a journal of your activities each day.

Using notes from the log book and photos on my hard drive, I was able to recall each of the days however perhaps footage does an even better job. If you would like to see a video of the trip, click through to Navick's [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj70EJOr7zs).

## Sailing Highlights 

 - hiking out on the windward side to decrease heel and increase our speed (a.k.a. human whisker pole)
 - racing *Pipsea* enroute to Virgin Gorda and again to Anegada
 - navigating through shallow channel on our approach to Anegada, where groundings are common
 - exhilarating downwind sailing through isolated storms from Anagada to Jost van Dyke
 - sailing with the crew of *Pipsea* from Diamond Cay to Great Harbor - they were so chill, while *Serenite* loved to race - it was good to experience the contrast

# CYC, Summer 2014
Jeanneau 43 *Pacific*

Upon returning from the BVI trip, I continued to sail every other week with [CSC](http://www.californiasailingcoop.org/index.html). When I expressed an interest in racing in the summer again, Jan from CSC introduced me to a few members of the [Cal Yacht Club](http://www.calyachtclub.com/). 

A few introductions later led me to Whitney, who owned a Jeanneau 43 *Pacific*. She was recruiting for the upcoming CYC Wednesday summer races as well as [Women at the Helm regattas](http://www.calyachtclub.com/files/ASMBYC2020WebCalendar.pdf). Out of a group of 15 crew, 8-10 of us would rotate in each Wednesday throughout the summer. 

After the first outing on June 25th, I invited Andrew to join the crew on future races. To level-up our skills, Whitney also hired an experienced racing coach, and we set aside one Sunday session so he could train us to work more seamlessly together. 

On the very next outing, we took first place.

This summarizes my sailing experience prior to meeting Andrew. Stay tuned for Andrew's story, the "prequel" to this timeline.
