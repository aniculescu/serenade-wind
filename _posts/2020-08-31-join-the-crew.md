Some of you have reached out to find out how to support us. Each time we hear this request from you, we're a little bit surprised, and the reason is this: 

We decided to begin this next chapter to learn how to approach life differently and share whatever we discovered along the way. It is our privilege to have this opportunity now, and we're delighted you would like to be part of it.

We value the *time* you have chosen to spend with us, reading our blog or following us on social media. If we make a connection with you based on the thoughts, stories and ideas we present, we are *thrilled*. So when you go further to volunteer to sponsor us financially, we are *speechless*.

If you would like to contribute, please consider joining the [Serenade Wind crew](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=30149836&fan_landing=true). Our sister site provides more information on what it means to be part of the crew, unlock the pirate's booty, and receive other exclusive access and benefits. 

If you're not in a position to contribute, our content is available for free here and represents about 80% of the total content we produce. 

In our next post, we'll announce the unique gift we'd like to share with the first 50 members of the Serenade Wind crew.
