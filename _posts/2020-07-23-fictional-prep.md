Patrick Chamoiseau's book Texaco when you are in Martinique. Francisco Goldman's The Long Night of White Chickens when you are in Guatemala. Wind from the Carolinas and Out Island Doctor for cruising the Bahamas.

Last Train to Paradise

A Sail of Two Idiots by Renee Petrillo

Swell

John Muir - Travels in Alaska, for anyone headed toward Glacier Bay, Wrangell, etc.

Herman Melville's Typee when we sailed into The Marquesas was amazing. More recently last year Agnes Newton Keith's Borneo trio about life there before during and after WWII and visiting her house was wonderful. Now although we have sailed much further west I'm reading Noel Barbers The War of the Running Dogs about the Malaysian Emergency of the 1950s.
