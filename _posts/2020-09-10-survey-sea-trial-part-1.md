excerpt: We wanted to do a round-up post of what we've done so far this year and then introduce part 1 of the Survey & Sea Trial series.

In serialized television shows, often times producers will insert a [clip show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_show) to bring the audience up-to-speed on complicated story arcs. At the start of the season, it may be a 2-minute intro before the premiere episode with rapid-fire voice over. Well, it's the middle of July, and we just finalized our travel plans to fly to Ft Lauderdale. For those of you who haven't read all 99 posts to date, let me catch you up.

# Recap

Last year in December, Andrew discovered that [s/v Rachel J Slocum](/about-rachel-j-slocum/) was available for sale. We drooled over the pictures and arranged to meet the owners in the spring.

As the entire world was going into lockdown in March, we flew to Ft. Lauderdale to see the boat and meet the owners. Upon our return, news around the world necessitated a pause on [buying our dream boat](/posts/boat-purchase/).

Despite not being able to move forward with the purchase, we were still making [preparations](/posts/30-weeks-to-minimalism/) to figure out what to bring and what to leave behind (give away or sell). It was then that we found out there was another interested party. 

To take the boat off the market and to give Bill piece of mind, we placed a [deposit into escrow](/posts/project-slocum-update/) and had a little celebration on the same week of [Andrew's birthday](/posts/happy-birthday/). Then we continued negotiations on the purchase agreement, which was finalized in June.

# Our Adventures

As we wrote about [In the Arena](/posts/in-the-arena/), the adventure begins when you decide to go, so we have spent most of the spring and summer chronicling those adventures about making some pretty tough decisions and having [emotional conversations](/posts/parental-reaction-part-1/). The hardest part was learning not be a control freak and to [go with the flow](/posts/going-with-the-flow/). You name it, and we let it go. 

Comfort? Gone. Sentimentality? Gone. Stuff? All Gone. 

Over the course of time, I took solace in these writings from Buddha,

> See them, floundering in their sense of mine, like fish in the puddles of a dried-up stream - and, seeing this, live with no mine, not forming attachment to experiences.

...and its corollary...

> Whatever is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness and benefit. 

When we stop the automatic thoughts in our head and we begin to live with intention, we discover a feeling of lightness. Such is the benefit of [minimalist living](/posts/30-weeks-to-minimalism/). Possessions no longer end up [owning you](/posts/relationship-with-money/). Living with intention means living with a greater awareness of the impact you're making on the world around you and to do what you can to make a change, whether it is finding [causes to support](/posts/philanthropy/) or becoming [ethical sailors](/posts/ethical-sailing/).

# Survey and Sea Trial

Switching gears now to the practical day-to-day matters, we have set aside 2 weeks in Ft Lauderdale. Here's the plan so far:

 - Sun: travel day 
 - Mon-Tue: inventory everything on RJ Slocum, decide with Bill on what items to keep
 - Wed: haul out and marine survey
 - Thu-Wed (roughly 1 week): bottom prep/paint, repairs
 - Wed: sea trial
 - Thu-Fri: finalize payment and title transfer
 - Sat: travel day

Much like the Project Slocum series, we will try to keep you up to date on this stage of the process over the next couple weeks in a Survey & Sea Trial series. Stay tuned for Part 2 on Monday.

# Seven Year Cycle

In the context of a tremendous year of transitions, turning 49 years old today holds a lot of meaning for me. For the longest time, the number "14" was my favorite number. Based on all that has happened this year, I think "49" is my new favorite number. Go '9ers!' 

I wrote about why in a previous post [Seven Year Cycle](https://www.patreon.com/posts/34976462/), along with a chronicle of all the major upheaval that occurred over the course of my life that happened to fall on a year that is divisible by the number "7". 

So in the spirit of growth through self-reflection, I would like to make a small request of *you*: 

>Take a moment to reflect on what has happened throughout your life. 

>Recall the events that occured when you turned *7 years old* and jot it down.

>What happened when you turned *14 years old* and *21 years old*? Write these down.

>Keep making your way through the years of your life at *28*, *35*, *42* and so on. 

>Then, for my birthday, please send those events in a direct message to me. And in return, I will send you the Seven Year Cycle post. 

This reflection may yield revelations too personal to share, for which I can empathize. Direct message me a quick "hello" or send pictures of yourself at each stage (see below), and I will send you the "Seven Year Cycle" story anyway.
