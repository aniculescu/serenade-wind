During this pivotal Sunday morning session, we chose to combine the following stickies to begin our discussion&#8230;

Improve or more sailing
Buy boat

Before we met, Andrew and I both spent a bit of time sailing. When he was living in British Columbia, he owned a catamaran (her name was Periwinkle) which he took out all the time on his own around Boundary Bay. I had taken a variety of ASA courses, joined a sailing club which got me out on a 36’ Catalina twice a month for a few years, chartered yachts from time to time, raced in the summer Wednesday sunset regattas out of Marina Del Rey, did a moonlight sail in San Francisco (caught in the fog with strong currents was a memorable experience), and crewed a 10-day trip island hopping in the British Virgin Islands.

After we met, we continued to do a little bit of sailing together and even went to Greece on a sailing trip from Corfu to Athens via Corinth Canal. But because life took us in different directions since then, we thought why not see how we can re-incorporate that love of sailing back into our lives.

The other big idea to tackle was how do you go about finding a job and get paid to do what you love doing.

Now I realize in the spectrum of <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</a>, this is akin to a level 5&#8230; self-actualization needs. Collectively, it seemed in varying degrees we weren’t struggling with levels 1 through 3; there may still be work to do in level 4; and certainly we wanted to see how we can put the idea of becoming the best person you can be in whatever way you can define it.

So that was it. In some respects, having chosen a few things to focus on suddenly made things actionable.

What does boat life mean to us?

Under a topic of “Boat Living,” we began to map out what that would look like to us. It could mean starting with expanding our sailing certification/knowledge/experience, learning boat maintenance, determining how long we would want to do it, then making a transition by downsizing all our belongings, maybe doing a trial run, and then finally buy a boat and move aboard.

We then assessed the pros and cons. At the top of the list of Pros: No commute! More Travel! More time together! Reduced possessions! I’ll underscore this point, because there is something about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsRP9EUrXjo">What’s in your backpack</a> speech that resonates with me. Imagine how much lighter it feels to move around having shed all this… this stuff. Now that it’s empty, you can then selectively curate experiences rather than possessions.

For me, I start to envision a mash-up of activities I love such as sailing to a remote island with rocky cliffs, dropping anchor, dinghy to shore, and rock climb/deep water solo existing routes or maybe even establishing new routes. 
How cool is that?

Other activities assumed while sailing would include music, seeing new places, hiking, even snowboarding if we were to sail to high latitude destinations, learning boat systems, doing more handy work, knitting, photography, reading, and of course cooking. Imagine being able to pursue your current passions and to be doing them <a href="https://youtu.be/EkI4VDQrH4Q?t=29">whenever the f*ck I please</a> (think Teddy KGB). Before my imagination runs amok, there are of course some downsides to this new lifestyle.

For us, the cons would include not having a reliable source of income and potentially reduced social life. If I were to pick the first thing to tackle, it would be the money. Time to go to the spreadsheet!

We began to do some research across bank accounts, 401Ks, etc. and once you add up all the bits and pieces into a spreadsheet… I was gobsmacked.

It’s a funny thing that at the start of my career, I set up all the automatic withdrawals, selected a few broad index growth funds and whammo, presto, ka-ching! Just like the empty backpack feeling, I was now looking at the world through a different lens of opportunities for adventure. All of a sudden, our lives in Southern California driving to and from work seemed so little. The liveaboard, offshore cruising life seemed like a very real and very sustainable possibility for the rest of our lives&#8230;
