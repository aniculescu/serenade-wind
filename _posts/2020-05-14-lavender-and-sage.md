# Why I knit

Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Andrew and I would hop in the car on weekends and run errands, head to the gym, shop for grocery, visit family, etc. Without fail, on each of these short outings, I would take along my current knitting project. Sometimes while I am standing in line, I will pull out my project and begin to knit. Others look at their cellphone, I knit.

I find it incredibly soothing and therapeutic. It allows my mind to focus on a single activity and block everything else out. My breathing is relaxed and I achieve a meditative state. Climbing brings the same relaxed state as well.

While knitting is making a [comeback](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/why-knitting-helps-with-stress-and-pain-2018-5 "why knitting helps with stress"), many [celebrities](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/know.html "celebrities who knit") are getting into it, and the benefits are tangible (to reduce stress and pain), it takes a certain level of patience to slog through the repetition of movements and a certain level of tenacity to complete a project over weeks and sometimes over months.

## It's not a quick hit

I am reminded of the students in my mom's crochet class. Earlier this year, she volunteered to teach crochet to seniors for 10 weeks, and I enjoyed hearing her plans for the class, the projects and of course how her students fared. Even with crochet, arguably the simpler and more forgiving skill to learn, one or two students would continue with the project outside of class time (i.e., homework). The others would work on their projects only during class and had very little to show for at the end of each session.

## It isn't for everyone

While it used to be an activity borne out of necessity, the industrial revolution has rendered it obsolete, except for as a hobby. For me it is one that is incredibly rewarding because it provides opportunities for creativity, feeling productive and at the same time therapeutic. Turns out it also helps cognitive function, thus staving off senility.

# Fiber Arts

During these first few months of retirement, I am spending more time knitting. The projects I had queued many moons ago are now being tackled. I have boxes of yarn stashed, neatly organized by project, just waiting for me to tackle and it brings me so much joy to be able to finish each project and to be able to share them with others.

At the same time, I have so many knitted and crocheted finished objects.

>40+ Hats & Toques
>
>30+ Scarves & Cowls
>
>10+ Sweaters & Tops
>
>50+ Mittens, socks, etc.

Bear in mind that this is also one of the areas targeted for downsizing since they all cannot come aboard our sailboat with us. We have a plan for this, which we will reveal in the upcoming weeks.

# Small Pleasures

The beauty of living in the present moment is gaining awareness, both internal and external. We described some of this in our previous post [Past, Present and Future](https://www.serenadewind.com/posts/past-present-and-future/ "Past, present and future"). As you tune into your external senses, you begin to appreciate the subtleties picked up by your senses.

I am reminded of scenes from Amelie who exemplifies these small moments in her every day life. This is depicted in the trailer for the film (see above).

# Lavender and Sage

I happened to tune into the scents of lavender and sage, which is the username by which I go by on [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/ "Ravelry"), a community site for fiber arts, including knitting, crocheting, weaving, spinning and dying yarns. Most of my projects can be found on this site, which has tracked my activity since May, 2012.

In addition to being a great resource, it is an area to organize projects, stash, needles, and patterns.

# Is it for you?

I come from a family of knitters. Both my mom and my grandmother knit. While I have been knitting on and off since the age of 11 years old, most of my recent skills have been self-taught watching youtube channels, trying out new stitches and techniques. and reading knitting blogs. It turns out you don't need to come from a family of knitters in order to start knitting. 

Just as it is with sailing. No one in Andrew's family or my family sail. Yet here we are reading, self-teaching, and one day [learning from Bill](https://www.serenadewind.com/posts/climb-until-you-fall "learning to sail from Bill") how to sail a schooner.
