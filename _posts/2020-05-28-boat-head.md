[30-weeks to minimalism](/posts/30-weeks-to-minimalism/) launched our 5 part series on how to downsize for the rest of your life. We followed this up with how to tackle [sentimental items](/posts/throw-back/) as well as clothes figuring out a way to [pack light](/posts/packing-light/). In part 3 of this series, we address the boat head or bathroom.

# Why is it called a head?

The [head](https://www.navy.mil/navydata/traditions/html/navyterm.html) aboard a boat is the bathroom. The term comes from the days of sailing ships when the place for the crew to relieve themselves was all the way forward on either side of the bowsprit, the integral part of the hull to which the figurehead was fastened.

We will do no such thing aboard [RJ Slocum](/about-rachel-j-slocum/).

# Features

To the uninitiated, this photo would not trigger a second look. However when Andrew and I first looked at this photo in December and read the specs, we were impressed with the following features:

-   Dry head - It doesn't seem like a big deal when you're used to it on land, however when transitioning from shore life to boat life, a wet head signals camping (in my mind). Wet heads are common on a variety of yachts, depending on what space vs. function trade-offs were being made by the designer. For example, some may want two wet heads for redundancy or additional occupants instead of one dry head. Regardless, having a dry head (shower in a separate compartment) is a necessity for _our_ liveaboard lifestyle.
-   Kentigern toilet - The Simpson Lawrence Kentigern toilet is considered the Rolls Royce of marine toilets. If you are considering one for yourself, unfortunately they are no longer being manufactured. However luckily for us, we can still find spares from [SL Spares](http://slspares.co.uk/) .
-   Ventilation - We were pleased to see that there are three hatches in this space. Ventilation is important to dry out the room and to reduce mildew. At the moment, we probably won't need to modify the [ventilation](https://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising/ventilation-tactics).

-   Porthole - From inside the shower, there is a porthole facing the salon (pictured above). Perhaps this is to allow in ambient light at night. Perhaps there is another reason (oh the stories this boat could tell...) Luckily, there is a curtain that can be closed for privacy.
-   Stowage - When we saw the boat for ourselves in March, we got to see the stowage available in the medicine cabinet, below the sink, above the toilet, etc. We also discovered there is additional stowage for wine.

Can you guess where the wine storage is? It appears we are running low...

# Adapting to voyaging life

After the closet, the next priority for the "pampered" woman is the bathroom. The storage inside the head of s/v Rachel J. Slocum provides for a limited amount of toiletries, first aid and other pharmaceutical items. Few shelves exist in the medicine cabinet, so we'll probably have to figure out our own solution to compartmentalize and store small items.

Downsizing from our current bathroom to this one will be less problematic since we are both low maintenance.

Last month, I met up with my friend Hasmik to buy her old Nikon camera equipment, and she reminded me just how low maintenance I was. She and I travelled on safari as well as hiked up Machu Picchu together. This was during my single years before meeting Andrew. Using herself as a comparison, where her only requirement is to apply mascara and eyeliner on each morning. she tells me,

> "I thought I was low maintenance, but you define low maintenance."

A large part of the voyaging lifestyle is becoming acutely aware of the impact we make on the environment. Just as we wrote up in [going green](/posts/going-green/), we want to live making deliberate choices about what we use on our body and how washing it off will end up in the ocean. It really makes you think twice about the chemicals used in cleaning products.

Gone are most of the items in our current medicine cabinet. What will survive are a few basic items along with first aid supplies (or as Bill's wife charmingly coins it, "the drugs.") Out Chasing Stars shares with us what is contained in their [offshore medical kit](https://outchasingstars.com/offshore-medical-kit-contents/).

# Linens

We have a fair number of queen and full size bedding in our house. We have flannels for cooler weather and a variety of bamboo as well as high thread count cotton sheets for the rest of the year.

Cruisers recommend darker colors or sheets with patterns to hide stains. We have mostly lighter shades. The Voyager's Handbook has a guideline as well for us to reference (e.g., 2 sets of sheets for each actively-used berth and 2 light blankets. For cooler climates, fleece blanket, half a dozen wool blankets and a comforter).

As I am taking inventory of what we have, we have more than enough, but rather than make educated guesses, we decided we would ask Bill.

Bill replied that we were welcome to any and all linens that are currently aboard RJ Slocum. That throws another curveball into the equation, since we will now need to bring aboard what we think we will need and marry this up with what he already has and then decide which will stay and which will take a trip to the dumpster.

All in all, we decided we'll need to revisit this when when we fly out for the marine survey and sea trial in the fall.
