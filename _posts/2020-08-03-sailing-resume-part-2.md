After Machu Picchu, I devoted more time to sailing and started up with classes once again to get more time on the water. In short order, I took Docking Endorsement as well as ASA 104 and ASA 105 during the spring of 2013.

## Docking Endorsement - May 2013
Catalina 36
Instructor: Ben

The docking class was awesome. Learned a lot, however the adage "if you don't use it, you lose it" applies here. I would do it again in a heartbeat, especially since docking seems to be the one aspect of sailing that freaks me out the most.

# Sunset Series Summer 2013
Catalina 34 "Cool Change"

My quest to get more time on the water also led me to joining the sunset series racing. I signed up for quite a few of these races which are held each Wednesday from Memorial Day to Labor Day. This experience helped me fine-tune sail trim, deploying spinnakers, and sailing wing-on-wing. I also met Hannah who eventually invited me along to a trip to the British Virgin Islands the following year.

# California Sailing Cooperative, Fall 2013 through 2014
Catalina 36 "Mystic"

In the fall of 2013, my friend Mark put me in touch with his sailing club, [CSC](http://www.californiasailingcoop.org/). He had been a member for quite some time and mentioned it to me during one of our bi-weekly Texas Hold'em games. There was a waiting list, but given my connection, I was quickly invited to a first test sail in September. 

The members of CSC join the club for a variety reasons:
- social interactions, sundowners, dock parties, etc.
- casual, stress-free daysails on the weekends with Captain and First Mate
- experience-based learning for ASA certifications

Since I had already passed several ASA courses, this club gave me an opportunity to get more experience and really dial-in my skills on a decent size keelboat as I was able to get out on the water twice a month. Sometimes if there were last minute cancellations, I would ask to join if I had a free weekend. 

From time to time, we had a chance to sail further afield and with different vessels. One of the skippers would charter a catamaran, taking us out to Malibu or another time, the skipper had chartered a smaller racing sailboat out of Long Beach so we can get to know a different marina.

And of course generally in the fall and winter months, we would delight in seeing dolphins swimming in our wake as well as seeing the sea lions sunning on buoys near the shipping lanes.

Members of the club also do their part to clean up the bay. Here is Mark using a boat hook and going through MOB steps to rescue a bunch of mylar balloons.

For those in Southern California, I highly recommend joining CSC. They are a tight-knit group of sailors that enjoy their sundowners, dock parties and Christmas events. Check out the [CSC Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/California-Sailing-Cooperative-466451460052235/) page for more pictures.

# Modern Sailing, Sausalito, October 2013
Beneteau 42

Sue and I became fast friends during our Machu Picchu expedition in the spring of 2013, especially as we toured other ruins in Lima along with Hasmik. In the fall, I had wanted to take a trip up to San Francisco for a foodie tour and decided to spend some time with her. While there, I thought I would book a moonlight sail out of Sausalito with [Modern Sailing](https://www.modernsailing.com/), an ASA school and club that came highly recommended by Hannah.

We picked up sandwiches for dinner aboard and set out of the relatively calm bay of Sausalito. The winds soon picked up once we left the protected area and we sailed at a pretty quick clip while the sun set behind the Golden Gate bridge off the starboard.

We continued on past Alcatraz while we saw the moon rise in the distance beyond the Bay Bridge. By then, we were experiencing strong currents pushing us toward Bay Bridge. 

Night had fallen and the fog rolled in. We tried to head back, but kept drifting backwards, so we fired up the motor and motorsailed slowly, making little progress as the wind and current kept pushing us back.

With little visibility and no GPS, we resorted to downloading apps on our phones to figure out where we were relative to Alcatraz. At one point, the skipper mentioned making landfall there if we weren't able to progress further in the next hour.

Sue probably hated me right then and there.

As the night ticked on, we crawled our way across the bay, finally arriving in Sausalito at 2 a.m. Sue drove us back to her house and we collapsed in our beds.
