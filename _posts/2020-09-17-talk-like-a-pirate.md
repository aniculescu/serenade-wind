# Aaarrr!

On September 19th of each year since 2002, the world over celebrates international talk like a pirate day. 

When I first learned about it a while ago, I thought it was a cute, an interesting way to adapt some speech patterns into my writing, but really didn't invest too much in it.

Now that we are owners of a schooner, we thought we might get a little bit more into the spirit of things.

# International Talk Like a Pirate Day

There's a charming blog that goes into the history, [talklikeapirate.com](http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/). There are loads of fun information and resources, such as [glossaries](http://talklikeapirate.com/wordpress/how-to/for-further-study/) and [translators](https://www.syddware.com/cgi-bin/pirate.pl) so you can pick up some terms.

# Grace O'Malley

Current Text:

I first learned of Grace O'Malley earlier this year through the Schooner Bums Facebook group. In it one of the members posted a link to an article written about the infamous [Irish pirate queen who conquered a man's world and faced down Queen Elizabeth I](https://allthatsinteresting.com/grace-omalley).

I thought it was pretty cool.

*A sea dog says 't this way. Arrr, so ye be wantin' t' go to sea an' ye don't be wantin' t' end up in Davy Jones' Locker. Then ye best be learnin' t' be talkin' like a buccaneer.*

*I first learned o' Grace O`Malley earlier this voyage through the Schooner Bums Facebook squadron. In 't one o' th' members posted a link t' an article written about th' infamous Irish shipmate queen who conquered a man's world an' faced down Queen Elizabeth I.*

*I thought 't be pretty cool. Ya scurvy dog who ortin' t' be keel hauled! What else ye got? An' be quick about it, I be shippin' out soon!*

# Other Female Pirates

After finding out about her existence, I then began to explore the interwebs. I uncovered quite a few other pirates/privateers in history, including:

-   Geography  
    -   Ching Shih
    -   Jacquotte Delahaye
    -   Anne Bonny
    -   Mary Read
    -   Charlotte de Berry
    -   Zheng Yi
    -   Rachel Wall
    -   Anne Dieu-le-Veut
    -   Charlotte Badger
    -   Jeanne de Clisson
    -   Sayyida al Hurra
    -   Mary Farley
    -   Mary Crickett

More is written up in the [Smithsonian article](https://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/grainne-mhaol-pirate-queen-of-connacht-behind-the-legend/), profiling a book.

# In other news...
