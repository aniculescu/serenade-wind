# Self-sufficiency 

One morning in early August, Andrew and I were discussing upcoming travel including the Ft Lauderdale trip. He admitted aloud that he hadn't spent any time thinking through what to expect. 

Generally, his preference when approaching anything new is to figure things out himself rather than rely too much on the opinions of others. He threw his iPhone onto the bed, 

>"Imagine we don't have any access to Google. Bill has circled the drain, and we need to figure this out for ourselves. What are you going to do?"

I shrugged. 

In my mind, I didn't think this mystery needed belaboring, but I understood his point. Andrew was taking every step of this process seriously. I took on faith what Bill had said in July. Bill has a history of sparing no cost when it comes to maintaining his boat over 30 years. He recommended using Interlux Micron 66 for the bottompaint. That was good enough for me.

Andrew absorbed this recommendation and then spent hours researching bottom paint performance. He started by reading through write-ups from [Jamestown Distributor](https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/document.do?docId=1177) including [Interlux Micron 66](https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=79), which was Bill's recommendation and [Sea Hawk Cukot](https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=59368), which was the boatyard's recommendation given that RJ Slocum had been sitting in water with lower salinity. We then had a follow-up call with Bill on the topic along with finalizing the travel plans in September.

# More Resources

I turned to my favorite resource, [Women Who Sail](https://www.womenwhosail.com/), and searched on previous related topics and uncovered some other datapoints. These included the following:

 - [Bottom Paint Test Report](https://www.practical-sailor.com/issues/34_10/features/Antifouling-Bottom-Paint-Evaluation_5675-1.html) - Practical Sailor examines antifouling paints after 1-year and 2-year in-water tests as 72 new paint panels are submerged in the Florida Keys and Long Island Sound. These test panels are pulled and examined for their resistance to hard growth and soft growth. Their detailed charts provide results for ablative paints, hard paints and specialty paints. The lineup of paints includes several low-copper and no-copper paints, as sailors look for viable alternatives to metal-based paints. 

 - [Quick Haul Out checklist](https://commutercruiser.com/quick-haul-out-checklist/) - Commuter Cruiser created a checklist which we found useful as new boat owners. These are broken down into the following steps:
     - Pre-Haulout Checklist: empty tanks, safe vessel lift points, instrumentation, propeller shaft, travel lift strap damage
     - Haulout Checklist: pressure wash, inspection, blocking the boat, jack stand placement
     - Hauled Out Checklist: to do list, check enginges, props, shafts, through-hulls, transducers, zincs & ground plates, anchors & chain, bottom prep, paint 
     - Launch Checklist: doublecheck before boat is out of the slings, make sure engine starts and no bilge or other leaks

# Choosing Antifoul 

Choosing the right antifoul for your boat depends on a number of variables: water temperature, oxygenation levels, salinity, current or movement, how much you sail and at what speed, hull material, etc. Its performance also depends on how it is applied and the integrity of the layers of coats underneath.  

In this specific use case, we wanted to know whether it would be disasterous slapping on a few coats of Micron 66 at this point, and so I posed the following question to the Women Who Sail:

>In a couple weeks, we will be doing a pre-purchase survey and sea trial on this beauty. 
>
>Currently, she is docked in New River (Ft Lauderdale, FL, USA) which has low levels of salinity. We were originally going to apply more coats of Micron 66 but we were told that another brand was better suited to low salinity. Our plan is not to keep her there beyond hurricane season. Our intended destination is to head to the Caribbean. 
>
>So if we were to continue with Micron 66, does anyone have any experience with how it will respond in locations with low salinity? 
>
>Appreciate any insights! üôè

Some responses mentioned having a great experience with [Pettit Trinidad Pro](https://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/show_product.do?pid=15184) and a couple echoed our presumption, which was to stick with Micron 66. 

[Suky Cannon](https://www.shambalasailingadventures.com/) (who has a USCG Master Mariner 100 Ton License and sails *Shambala*, a classic Morgan 41 sloop and teaches in the Bahamas and Florida Keys) recommended that we not to put it on until we leave the low salinity waters and referred us to [Royale Palm Marina](https://royalepalmmarina.com/), a fast, efficient boatyard in Dania. The boatyard has no fixed bridges between its location and the ocean, which allows for quick and easy access.

Vanessa Linsley (who has lived and sailed for 30 years on *Anney Bonney* a CT 42 designed by William Garden) added that if the paint isn't breaking down now when we do the haul out, do it when we're ready to splash and head south. She went on to describe the current water condition in south Florida and in particular oxygenation levels (not salinity) which leads to brackish content. She describes that the water in New River is different than normal, and she wouldn't be surprised if the water changes due to human assistance to agitate more oxygen into the water to deal with the problem. 

I was gobsmacked. Their insights were detailed, specific, and actionable. 

We also reached out to Interlux with the same question. Despite the fact that the representative sounded like he had marbles in his mouth, we understood enough to learn the following: 

 - With Micron 66, there's not enough salt water at 11 ppm to trigger ablation. Since RJ Slocum is sitting in fresh water, we won't know which product to use until after the pressure wash. 

 - If we see cornflaking and need to put it back in fresh water, we'll need to go with another product such as Interlux Micron Extra. Since its ablation process is trigger by movement, we would have to clean the bottom every 2-3 weeks and then when we need to haul out for another bottom paint in the Caribbean, we can go back to Micron 66.

 - If we find another location to dock with higher salinity, then we can stick with Micron 66 and it will self-polish until we come back to move aboard full time in October. 

I like the problem-solving aspect of this new lifestyle. Everyday is certainly an adventure! 

So, with that in mind, what did we see during the haul out?

# Harbour Towne Marina

Yesterday, we met Bill at RJ Slocum and motored down the channel to [Harbour Towne Marina](http://www.harbourtownemarina.com/) for the haul out.
