# Menu planning

A 4-week passage is roughly 30 days of breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Andrew and I tend not to eat breakfast, however we might want to anticipate needing to keep blood sugar levels up regardless of what is "typical."

One of the few things I kept in mind while planning menus for this passage is to make sure that all your food can be easily eaten without the fuss of having to tend to a stove for too long, foods that may spill easily, and avoid ingredients in packaging that create a lot of waste. On the other hand, I sought out meals that can be eaten with your hands to minimize clean up down below. 

Keep in mind that our first passage will be beating east toward Nevis and so we'll be facing quite a bit of weather. So I made sure to stock up on things we enjoyed eating and some bland foods to settle our stomach just in case we get nauseous for the first few days.

Serenade Wind recipes are linked to the corresponding posts, otherwise, I will be referencing the tried-and-true [Joy of Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-of-Cooking/dp/0743246268) for anything that isn't store bought.

## Breakfast

Despite breakfast being the most important meal of the day, Andrew and I generally skip it. 

 - Coffee - three pounds of a combination of ground coffee and whole beans. We have a variety of options to make coffee: pour over, French press and stove-top espresso.
 - Tea - a variety of caffeinated green tea & black tea as well as herbal teas to sooth any condition 
 - Protein bars - our favorites include: KIND Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, KIND Almond & Coconut, and KIND Sweet & Spicy Cayenne BBQ Almond
 - Bananas - first to be eaten due to spoilage; can last only 2-7 days at room temperature
 - Apples - refrigerated, they can last 1-2 months; at room temperature, 5-7 days
 - Oranges - can last up to 21 days refrigerated and 10-14 days at room temperature
 - Hard boiled eggs - boiled ahead in batches during calmer seas, these can be eaten at breakfast or snacked on throughout the day. [Raw eggs](https://theboatgalley.com/how-to-store-eggs-without-refrigeration/) can be stored without refrigeration by applying Vaseline and turning over every 2-3 days.

## Lunch

When the seas are becalmed, we'll have plates of sandwiches and pasta salad available for the crew. Most of these will be pantry-friendly. 

 - Salame and parmesan sandwiches - salame (cured, air-dried can last for months at room temperature) as well as parmesan are shelf-stable at cool temperatures and do not need to be refrigerated
 - Sardine sandwiches - we brought a dozen cans of [Portuguese sardines](https://www.amazon.com/Angelo-Parodi-Portuguese-Sardines-Selected/dp/B0842BT29W/) from home. Andrew has eaten these in a pinch when he wants to nosh at night. Goes great with generous slather of salted butter.
 - [Chicken salad sandwiches](/posts/pantry-proteins/) - in addition to the recipe we tried, you can substitute tuna or salmon for chicken and add celery, grapes, and onion to round out the flavors.
 - Mediterranean pasta salad - one of our favorite salads at home is one prepared by Andrew and primarily profiles tomato, onion, cucumber, olives and feta. This variation bulks up the salad with pasta and a protein (tuna), making it a full meal on its own. This keeps well in the refrigerator for days. 

Store-bought sourdough bread tends to keep longer before going stale. We bought a few loaves with a one kept in the freezer and for the final couple weeks of passage, I'll bake our own bread.

## Dinner

Assuming we don't catch fish during this passage, we'll be relying on what we bring with us. Most of these dishes have been chronicled earlier this summer and I'm excited to be prepare these on a smaller scale. 

 - [Spam musubi](/posts/pantry-proteins/) - rice, spam, furikake
 - [Savory breakfast casserole](/posts/cook-now-explore-later/) or [impossible pie](/posts/pantry-proteins/) - bacon, cheese, eggs, milk
 - [Vegetarian curry](/posts/counting-chickens/) - onions, garlic, yellow squash, ginger. Zucchini, potatoes, cauliflower, eggplant and other vegetables can be substituted as well depending on your preferences.
 - [Braised short ribs](/posts/cook-now-explore-later/) and rice - scallions, beef or country-style pork, pear juice, onions, carrots, garlic, rice 
 - [Creole crab cakes](/posts/pantry-proteins/) or [salmon cakes](/posts/canned-food-recipes/) - both of these were among our top picks from the pantry protein adventure and will provide a nice break from the land-centric dishes profiled here.

I'm also inspired by one-pot meal ideas whether they can be done in the Cuchen pressure cooker when we run the engines or stove-top. Wavetrain had a charming write-up called [Haute Boat Cuisine](https://wavetrain.net/2015/07/23/haute-boat-cuisine-how-to-eat-well-on-a-cruising-boat-without-really-trying/), offering ideas to pan fry onions & potatoes and then throwing a can of Dinty Moore stew on top. Other quick options are classics such as [tuna rice casserole](https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/recipe/052470/easy-tuna-casserole) and [chicken a la king](https://thestayathomechef.com/chicken-a-la-king/).

## Snacks

Finally, for noshing on throughout the day, we profile a combination of sweet and savory options. This area will most likely rely on store-bought products initially to save on propane and time such as

 - Crackers
 - Chips
 - Ginger snaps

...followed by homemade snacks we love, including
  
 - [Condensed milk cookies](/posts/canned-food-recipes/) 
 - [Crack salami](/posts/pantry-proteins/)
 - [Bacon-wrapped dates](/posts/go-no-go-decision/)

# Volume

Once the menu is planned, next comes deciding the quantities that will need to be purchased. This is where a spreadsheet comes in handy.

This is how my mind works, so bear with me on how this is organized. The reference column denotes a number that corresponds to the storage space available, be it pantry drawers, refrigerator, freezer, spice rack, etc. Those spaces are further categorized between dry, chilled (below the waterline, i.e. bilge), fresh (i.e., refrigerator) or freezer. Each of the items are earmarked for certain recipes, although I do make allowances for staples in a lot of items that wouldn't be worth portioning to serving sizes. 

I have notations on converting ingredients from their weight to meal equivalents. After that, I let excel do what it does best and convert an array of ingredients to corresponding dishes and multiply by number of days and number of individuals to know exactly how much to purchase. This information is "pushed" between knowing quantity on hand and desired quantity. 

Since we also don't want to live on the edge of starvation, I grossed up the quantities to allow for extended delays.

# Stowage 

Following that, comes stowage of these items. Because we know how much to buy, it will be a matter of finding and optimizing lots of dry storage space. We have another tab in our excel spreadsheet that records the volume in cubic feet of each stowage space. 

There's about 5% of dedicated space for food on the boat. As a foodie, this is one of the more depressing stats I have faced to date versus over 50% of dedicated space for spares, which are necessary for bluewater cruisers to remote areas where you cannot get access to parts. I am reminded in part of another story about [sourcing parts from Gambia](https://wavetrain.net/2020/01/30/sourcing-parts-in-gambia-from-the-fixing-your-boat-in-exotic-places-department/) from Wavetrain and in particular the quote:

>Because liveaboard cruising sailors both fear and crave the prospect of being thrust upon their own resources in this way, they tend to save things. No knowledgeable reader, for example, will wonder for a moment what I did with my old shrouds after I replaced them. I saved them, of course, and stored them away with all the other detritus left over from dozens of other repair and maintenance projects.
>
>The conceit, of course, is that someday some of this junk might actually prove useful. All sailors, in their hearts, imagine themselves drawing on their supply of hoarded bits and pieces to engage in some ingenious rubber-band-and-bubble-gum feat of jury-rigging wherein their vessels are miraculously saved from certain destruction. 

And so I put up with the valuable stowage space that is dedicated to detritus... ahem, spares... and [go with the flow](/posts/going-with-the-flow/). To the extent that we can, we have been stocking up on the shelf-stable ingredients *in advance* of our [haul out](/posts/survey-sea-trial-part-3/) in December. This way the stowage is largely solved, leaving perishable, fresh ingredients until days before we determine our weather window and we cast off.

## Making Room

From our POD transport, we brought a variety of ingredients with us from California that I didn't want to go to waste. To make room for the passage provisioning, I spent most of November drawing down on these ingredients with recipes such as:
  
 - No boil lasagna & roasted garlic slices - [Small batch lasagna](https://www.simplyscratch.com/2020/03/small-batch-lasagna.html)  
 - Cake flour - [Moist chocolate chip muffins](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/moist-chocolate-chip-muffins/)
 - Bisquick - [Banana bread](https://insanelygoodrecipes.com/bisquick-banana-bread/)

Needless to say, it's been a delicious month while planning for this passage!
