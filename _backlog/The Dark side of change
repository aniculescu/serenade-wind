The Dark side of change

Wayne Gretzky once said: "You miss 100% of the shots you never take." It is too easy to imagine change and dream about its benefits.  Denise and I will be exploring the world via sailboat and the stress of the rat race will be left in our wake.  This dream and part of the story already outlined in previous posts. 

Why do we wake up one day and declare war on "life?" We look for the excitement of the change, much like trying a daring new activity (rock climbing) or experiencing exotic travel.  We search for purpose, and somewhere below the conscious level we realize we don't have one. So we simply search.

The dark side of change is this unconscious realization of lack of purpose. It manifests in ongoing restlessness and often comes with little appreciation for the now. I need a new phone, travelling to Morocco, this Costco deal is too good to pass up (I'm excited for the challenge of consuming 5gal of Mayo), etc. The insane need to visually document and share everything becomes the closure I need. 

If we pause and step back to observe our own, but more easily others' behaviour of a purposeless life it can be quite funny. Or you better laugh to avoid a more undesireable reaction.
